Kylie Jenner reveals baby Stormi's pierced ears
Kylie Jenner has revealed that she has had her five-month-old baby's ears pierced.
The 20-year-old model posted a short Snapchat video entitled "the best kisses" showing a close-up of her and baby Stormi cuddling on the bed.
As Stormi plays with Jenner's hair, and gives it a playful tug, a gold stud earring can clearly be seen in the baby's earlobe.
Jenner responds to the hair-pull by planting a big kiss on Stormi's face.
The businesswoman - who has recently been named one of Forbes magazine's richest self-made women - has said she will consider passing on her cosmetics empire to Stormi "if she's into it".
Kylie Cosmetics has sold more than $630m (£475m) worth of products.
Forbes has estimated the company is worth $800m (£600m).
Jenner had her first child with rapper and producer Travis Scott, 27, in February.
The youngest woman on the list, Jenner ranked at number 27, beating her sister Kim Kardashian West, who made it to 54th place.
However, some have questioned her suitability at being labelled "self-made", due to the vast influence of the Kardashian-Jenner family behind her.
