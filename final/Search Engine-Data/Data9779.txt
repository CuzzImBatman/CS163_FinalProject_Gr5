Dem Civil War: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez knocks Dem senator who warned far left can't win the Midwest.
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the self-declared socialist who defeated fourth-ranking House Democrat Joe Crowley of New York last week, shot back Sunday at a sitting Democratic senator who questioned the efficacy of embracing the far left in a presidential race.

Appearing on the Sunday morning talk show circuit on CNN, Sen. Tammy Duckworth said such a strategy would be destined for failure in the Midwest, which the Illinois Democrat said would be critical to winning a presidential race. “And I don’t think you can go too far to the left and still win the Midwest — coming from a Midwestern state," she said.

She further opined that the socialist policies Ocasio-Cortez openly espouses are the “future of the Bronx, where she is," and not the "industrial Midwest." 

As a rebuttal, Ocasio-Cortez pointed to the success Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., had during the 2016 Democratic primaries against Hillary Clinton.
