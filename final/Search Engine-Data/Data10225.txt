Nintendo's premier strategy-RPG series Fire Emblem is getting a new entry, which was revealed at the E3 2018 Nintendo Direct presentation. While the trailer for the game reveals several new gameplay elements, long-time fans will rejoice that it looks to remain true to the series' core gameplay mechanics.
In the trailer, the series' traditional grid-based gameplay is on full display, and the story seems to play out the same as previous games, with large character portraits acting and reacting on-screen. But there are some surprising differences as well. For one, the battle screens are filled with armies rather than characters duking it out one-on-one; you directly command one character, but that character is leading a small battalion of other soldiers who join in on the attack. And you seem able to explore a fully realized, 3D world, instead of the simple, top-down style of older titles.
The game's protagonists looks new, and there weren't any returning characters featured in the trailer, but you can never rule out the possibility of cameos in a Fire Emblem game. With a release date slotted in for Spring 2019, we'll likely learn much more about the game in the coming year. And for more news from the show, check out our Nintendo news roundup.
