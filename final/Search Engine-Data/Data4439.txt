 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - MetLife Inc. ( MET.N ), the largest U.S. life insurer, said on Friday it agreed to pay $19 million to settle an investigation by New York State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer into fees paid to insurance brokers. 

 The settlement is likely Spitzer's last as attorney general, and the latest of a string of settlements with insurance companies accused of paying improper fees to brokers to win business. Spitzer will take office as New York's governor on January 1. MetLife will pay $16.5 million to policyholders and $2.5 million of civil penalties. It admitted no liability, but agreed to stop paying so-called "contingent commissions" to insurance brokers for life, disability and other group products, and to change other business practices. Spitzer and other critics have said such commissions amount to kickbacks, and result in brokers getting worse prices for companies seeking insurance. Insurers and brokers including Marsh & McLennan Cos. ( MMC.N ), Ace Ltd. ( ACE.N ), American International Group Inc. ( AIG.N ), St Paul Travelers Cos. STA.N and Zurich Financial Services ( ZURN.VX ) have settled with Spitzer for their payment or receipt of contingent commissions. But other insurers, including Wells Fargo & Co.'s ( WFC.N ) Acordia, have said their payment of contingent commissions was not illegal. Andrew Cuomo, a former U.S. secretary of housing and urban development under President Bill Clinton, will replace Spitzer as attorney general. Spitzer built much of his reputation on policing alleged abuses in the financial, insurance and mutual fund industries. MetLife shares fell 49 cents to close at $59.01 on Friday.
