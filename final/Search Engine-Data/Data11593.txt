'World's ugliest dog' Zsa Zsa wins $1,500 prize
The owner found the English bulldog, who has an underbite and a noticeably long tongue, on a pet search website.
A nine-year-old English bulldog called Zsa Zsa has won this year's world's ugliest dog contest.
The pooch's owner Megan Brainard, from Anoka, Minnesota, will receive $1,500 (£1,100) following the victory in Petaluma, California.

Ms Brainard found Zsa Zsa, who has an underbite and a noticeably long tongue, on a pet search website.
During the competition, now in its 30th year, the canines flaunt their imperfections as they walk down a red carpet with their handlers and are evaluated by a panel of judges.
The 2018 contest included a blackhead-covered Chinese Crested-Dachshund, a bulldog mix with excess wrinkly skin and a Pekingese named Wild Thang.
The event, at the Sonoma-Marin Fairgrounds, north of San Francisco, helps organisers publicise that many pets are available for adoption.
Christy Gentry, a spokeswoman for the event, said: "The world's ugliest dog contest is an iconic tradition of the Sonoma-Marin Fair.
"And with so many lovable animals displaced and available for adoption, we want our fans to know what this contest is really about.
"It's a fun and silly way to advocate that all animals deserve a safe and loving home."
Last year's winner was Martha - a 125lb Neapolitan Mastiff with a droopy face.
The contest is usually held on a Friday night, but organisers moved this year's competition to Saturday in an effort to draw a bigger audience.
