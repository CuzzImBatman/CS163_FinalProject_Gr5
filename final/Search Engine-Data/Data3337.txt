Cerebral palsy didn't stop this 9-year-old girl from saving her baby brother from drowning
(CNN)Lexie Comeau-Drisdelle can't walk or talk, but she saved her baby brother from drowning, earning her hero status in her hometown of Halifax, Nova Scotia.

This small but mighty hero was ready to celebrate her ninth birthday with family and friends, including her 1-year-old brother, Leeland.
With the rest of the family caught up in getting ready for the party and not paying attention to him, Leeland decided to take a walk to the backyard and jump into the pool.
But Lexie, who always keeps her eyes on her little brother, saw the potential tragedy unfold.
Lexie has cerebral palsy, a disorder of movement, muscle tone or posture that is caused by damage that happens during the development of the brain. That means she isn't able to speak and couldn't run after her brother, but she knew she had to alert others to help him.
Realizing her baby brother could be in trouble, she began to scream.

So, she did the only thing she could, and let out the loudest scream her lungs could possibly give.
"I was upstairs changing for the party, her dad was picking up her older brother, and my mom was in the kitchen, when suddenly I just heard Lexie screaming. I panicked and immediately thought 'Oh no, she must have fallen off her chair,' " said Kelly Jackson, Lexie's mother.
