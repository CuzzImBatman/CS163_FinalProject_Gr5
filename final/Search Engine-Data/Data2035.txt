Thai cave rescue: Hollywood producers plan major film
The rescue of 12 boys and their football coach from a cave in Thailand - in a race against time and the rain - has captivated the world.
But even as the complex rescue was underway, with the safety of the boys far from assured, plans for a Hollywood film were springing into action.
As teams of navy SEALs and cave diving experts from across the globe extracted the boys one by one from Tham Luang cave in Chiang Rai province, Hollywood producers were already on the scene.
American producer, Michael Scott, who travelled to the rescue scene with co-producer Adam Smith to conduct preliminary interviews, told Australian news outlet APP: "I see this as a major Hollywood film with A-list stars."
Mr Scott is the managing partner of Pure Flix, an American production company known for its Christian and family friendly films, and based in Scottsdale, Arizona.
The company is understood to be attempting to talk to the boys, their families and the rescuers to gain exclusive rights to tell their story.
He also said they were applying no pressure on people to talk.
The slowly unfolding saga of the boys' story lends itself perfectly to a film plot.
The boys - all aged 11 to 16 and players in the Wild Boars football team - were missing for a week, before being found alive, deep within the 10km (6 mile) cave complex.
