Aetna profit beats street view

 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. health insurer Aetna Inc. ( AET.N ) on Thursday said quarterly profit rose 28 percent on moderating medical costs and higher enrollment, beating Wall Street's projections and pushing shares sharply higher. 

 The third-quarter results from the nation's No. 3 insurer, which also forecast 2006 and 2007 profit above analysts' expectations, stood in stark contrast to its previous two quarters that soundly disappointed investors. "Aetna's quarter will send the entire managed care group higher today, because there was lingering concern in the market that the company would report another disastrous quarter," CIBC analyst Carl McDonald wrote in a research note. Aetna shares rose as much as $3.85, or 10 percent, to $42.38 in opening trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares rose as much as 11 percent earlier in the session to their highest level since April, although the shares remain down about 10 percent this year. Shares of rivals UnitedHealth Group Inc. ( UNH.N ) and WellPoint Inc. ( WLP.N ), which earlier this month reported strong quarterly profit growth, rose modestly. Net income at the Hartford, Connecticut-based company rose to $476 million, or 85 cents per share, from $373 million, or 62 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding gains of 6 cents per share from the reversal of reserves from prior periods and 1 cent per share from net capital investment, earnings were 78 cents per share. Analysts on average had expected 72 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Aetna's full-service health care plans had 15.38 million members, up about 730,000 from a year earlier but down about 24,000 from the second quarter. For its commercial business, Aetna's medical cost ratio -- a key barometer that measures medical costs as a percentage of premium dollars -- improved 2.1 percentage points from the second quarter to 79.3 percent. "We are very pleased to see that our commercial risk medical cost ratio improved ... from the second quarter level and our medical cost trend moderated as well," Chief Executive Ron Williams said in a statement. Revenue rose 11 percent to $6.3 billion. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 18.4 percent from 19.3 percent a year earlier. Goldman Sachs analyst Matthew Borsch said all segments of the company, including healthcare, were above his estimates. The company raised its full-year operating earnings forecast to $2.83 per share from its prior view of $2.77 to $2.79. Analysts had expected $2.76. For 2007, it gave a preliminary forecast of operating earnings of $3.26 per share. Borsch said he expected the market to see the 2007 outlook as a "significant positive surprise." He noted that the outlook was above his estimate of $3.20, above the Street's view of $3.15, and that it excludes any benefit tied to possible future share repurchases.
