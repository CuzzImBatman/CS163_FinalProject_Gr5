Airbus BelugaXL plane has received a quirky new makeover — and it’s already making people smile.

The aeronautics company rolled out the new look, in which the massive plane now resembles a white beluga whale.

The adorable paint job was voted on by Airbus employees, who wanted the design to look more like a whale. Forty percent voted in favor of the animal design, which included bright blue eyes and a smiling black mouth.

So far, those who have seen photos of the plane, unveiled last week in France, have been pleasantly surprised.

“I like the custom paint job that Airbus put on their ‘Beluga XL’ transport plane,” one person wrote on Twitter.

“Love the new Beluga XL,” another tweeted.

The Airbus was originally called an A300-600ST, but it quickly earned its whale nickname because of the uncanny resemblance the plane had to the white beluga whale, with its signature forehead hump.

The BelugaXL, which was designed in 2014 aiming to address the need for larger planes, will enter its cute new look into service in 2019, the brand said in a press release.
