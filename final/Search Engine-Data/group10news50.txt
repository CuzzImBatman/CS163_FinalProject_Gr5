Has George Ezra changed his mind about Three Lions?
Ahead of England's loss to Croatia, George Ezra posted a video on Twitter asking fans to buy and stream football anthem Three Lions to knock his own song from the top of the charts.
He said it was "amazing" his song Shotgun had been number one for two weeks but "I think it's time we knock it off the top spot with Three Lions".
However, following England's defeat he wasn't so sure, telling Sky News: "Generosity goes so far. I'm easy, we'll see. The fact that I was number one for a week, let alone two, is just mind-blowing."
A keen football fan, he is managing to stay positive over the semi-final loss: "There was a point where I was not a happy bunny last night, but the thing I was excited about was just the tournament as a whole, reminding me every four years when it comes around that it brings everyone together."
He went on to describe this year's competition as "so enjoyable because there was such an air of calm... For me personally, it was nice to wear the St George's flag again and be confident about it".
Ezra also told Sky News that writing a football anthem is "only easy if you get it right".
He is not sure he'd ever do it himself, saying: "It's so hard - it's like a Christmas song. It's only easy if you get it right."
The clean-living pop star admitted to being less than demanding when on tour, confirming that his rider is often simply a kettle, lemon and honey.
But he went on: "Frustratingly I do turn into a diva because the kettle often isn't there."
On the subject of coping with sudden success, he said: "When you're in the middle of it, it's hard to take it all in, and my time off is so precious because it's few and far between. Straight away I go and see my friends, and not much changes."
Ezra's new album, Staying At Tamara's, is out now.
