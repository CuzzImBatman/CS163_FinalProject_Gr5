At EA's press conference at E3 2018, Anthem took centerstage as the publisher highlighted the action RPG in a short gameplay video. Now, we're getting a full look at the game's Scar and Villainy mission, as BioWare has released a 20 minute video of its E3 gameplay demo, complete with commentary from Anthem's lead producer Ben Irving. Check it out above.
In Anthem, you play as a Freelancer with access to Javelins, mech exosuits that come with different abilities and loadouts. In the gameplay demo, you can see a team of Freelancers; the leader plays a Colossus, a tank-like character that packs a punch, another player chooses a fast-moving Ranger, and the final player picks a Colossus with a different loadout, focused on close combat.
As the demo starts, you get to see the game's reactive world on display; flying through a waterfall, for example, will cool the jets on your jetpack. As the players traverse the world, flying, running, and swimming, they battle waves of enemy Scars, eventually entering a Stronghold, a dungeon of sorts with big enemies and bigger rewards. Meanwhile, the game's co-op gameplay is shown off; another player joins in mid-mission, and Irving emphasises Anthem's design as a cooperative game that provides big payoffs for playing together.
Finally, the demo ends with the team fighting a fierce Swarm Tyrant. We'll no doubt see more of the game over the next few months, before its release on February 22, 2019.
