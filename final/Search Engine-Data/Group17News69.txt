Nintendo's E3 2018 showing may have been primarily focused on Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, but the company also shared some new details about the upcoming Pokemon RPGs for Switch, Let's Go Pikachu and Let's Go Eevee. Among other things, we've learned that players will indeed be able to capture the Kanto starter Pokemon--Bulbasaur, Charmander, and Squirtle--in the wild.
During a hands-on session with the titles, we spotted and captured both Bulbasaur and Pikachu in the wild. The demo was set entirely within the Viridian Forest, so it isn't surprising that we came across Pikachu, as the forest was one of two areas it could be found in the original Red and Blue versions. However, starter Pokemon like Bulbasaur aren't traditionally available in the wild in other Pokemon RPGs.
While you'll have a much easier time of getting all the Kanto starters in the Let's Go titles, it appears they'll still be harder to find than other Pokemon. During our demo session, Pidgey, Caterpie, and Weedle were much more plentiful in the wild. We also came across a few Oddish, which couldn't previously be found in Viridian Forest.
Let's Go Pikachu and Let's Go Eevee are inspired by Pokemon Yellow, and the version you choose will determine whether Pikachu or Eevee will accompany you through the adventure. The Pokemon Company has previously said that you can't evolve the Pikachu or Eevee you start with, but you will be able to evolve any that you capture or transfer from Pokemon Go.
Pokemon: Let's Go Pikachu and Let's Go Eevee launch for Switch on November 16. The games will release alongside the Poke Ball Plus, a controller shaped like a Poke Ball.
