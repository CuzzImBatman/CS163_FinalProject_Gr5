Nintendo Switch owners looking for something to play on the hybrid console have a few new options to choose from. On top of this week's new releases, Nintendo has added a couple of free first-party demos to the Eshop, giving you a chance to try out two of its upcoming Switch titles ahead of their launch.
First, Switch owners can download a demo of the upcoming action-puzzle game Sushi Striker: The Way of Sushido, which launches for both Switch and 3DS on June 8. Sushi Striker is developed by indieszero, the studio behind Theatrhythm Final Fantasy, and was one of our favorite games from PAX East 2018. The free demo allows you to play through the first several stages of the single-player campaign.
In addition to that, Switch owners can now download the beta client for the upcoming Mario sports game, Mario Tennis Aces. However, like the Global Testpunch and Testfire betas that Nintendo hosted for Arms and Splatoon 2, respectively, the Mario Tennis Aces beta will only be playable during a specific window of time. This means you won't actually be able to try it just yet, but it is good to prepare for it ahead of time.
The Mario Tennis Aces "Pre-Launch Online Tournament" takes place next week, from June 1-3. At the beginning, it will feature four playable characters--Mario, Peach, Yoshi, and Bowser--but you'll be able to unlock five additional ones if you play well enough. You'll also be able to unlock a free bonus costume in the full game by participating in the beta.
