Ontario government cancels 758 renewable energy contracts, says it will save millions
Ontario's new Progressive Conservative government is cancelling 758 renewable energy contracts, in what it says is an effort to reduce electricity bills in the province.Energy Minister Greg Rickford said the move will save provincial ratepayers $790 million — a figure industry officials dispute, saying it will just mean job losses for small business.Ontario's getting out of the 'carbon tax business,' Doug Ford says. But what's next?In a statement Friday, Rickford said the government plans to introduce legislation during its summer sitting that would protect hydro consumers from any costs incurred from the cancellation.Doug Ford's environmental policies light on details, advocates say"For 15 years, Ontario families and businesseshave been forced to pay inflated hydro prices so the government could spend on unnecessary and expensive energy schemes," Rickford said. "Those days are over."The government announcement does not indicate which specific projects are being cancelled.Rickford said the move is part of a campaign pledge the Progressive Conservatives made during the spring election to end the projects."We clearly promised we would cancel these unnecessary and wasteful energy projects as part of our plan to cut hydro rates by 12 per cent for families, farmers and small businesses," Rickford said."In the past few weeks, we have taken significant steps toward keeping that promise."John Gorman, president of the Canadian Solar Industries Association, called the government decision to cancel the projects "rash." Gorman said the move will hurt small investors who have put solar panels on their rooftops or properties.
