Justin Bieber's former neighbor demands for singer's arrest: report
Justin Bieber‘s former neighbor wants the singer arrested for allegedly skipping out on a deposition so he could make out with Hailey Baldwin.

Jeffrey Schwartz, the man whose Calabasas, Calif., home Bieber allegedly egged in January 2014, filed paperwork Thursday demanding a warrant be issued for the pop star after he allegedly bailed on a deposition last week to prance around the Big Apple with friend-with-benefits Baldwin.

According to documents obtained by The Blast, Schwartz is also asking for Bieber, 24, to shell out $1,000 for every day he misses his deposition.

The scheduled deposition last week was reportedly the fifth one he has skipped over the last two years.

Bieber’s legal team told TMZ that the “Love Yourself” singer provided alternative dates for a deposition, but that Schwartz’s lawyers rushed to file for a warrant before trying to reschedule — and the singer’s attorneys also claimed that he has never been personally served with the lawsuit.

Bieber was already criminally charged for the egging and paid $80,000 in restitution, but Schwartz’s civil case, originally filed in 2015, seeks an additional $25,000 in damages for pain and suffering and emotional distress that he claims his family has suffered since living next door to Bieber in their gated community.

Schwartz specifically claims that Bieber used anti-Semitic epithets in his egg-tossing tantrum, and alleges that he, his wife and daughter have all been plagued with stomachaches, headaches and sleeplessness because of Biebs’ bad behavior.

A rep for Bieber did not immediately return a request for comment.
