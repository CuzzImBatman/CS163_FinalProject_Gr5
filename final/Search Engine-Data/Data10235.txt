Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is bringing back an enormous roster of previous Smash characters along with a handful of new additions, and some are getting the Amiibo treatment. Ridley, Samus' arch-nemesis, is getting one of his own, along with the new Inkling and Daisy. Apparently they're bringing friends.
The Japanese Nintendo site (via Nintendo Everything) confirmed that the company is planning Amiibo for other returning fighters. Specifically, they've named Ice Climbers from the game of the same name and Pichu from Pokemon, though there may be others in the works as well.
That's not to say that the entire roster will necessarily be represented. There are already 66 confirmed characters and likely at least another few on the way. Producing all new Amiibo for all of them would be a daunting task. That said, we may see some new sculpts and poses for some of the more popular characters.
Smash Bros. Ultimate will feature every character to ever appear in a Smash Bros. game, even if they were added later as DLC. That includes the classic roster of 12 mainstays like Mario and Link, more recent third-party additions like Bayonetta and Solid Snake, and even more obscure one-timers like Palutena from Kid Icarus.
