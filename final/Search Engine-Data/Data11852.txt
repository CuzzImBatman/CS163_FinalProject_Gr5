Soil eroded by glaciers may have kick-started plate tectonics.
Vast amounts of sediment eroded from Earth’s continents were necessary to lubricate the wheel of plate tectonics, scientists propose. The idea offers a new angle on long-standing riddles about the origin and evolution of the planet’s global surface recycling system, one that is unique in the solar system.
Earth’s interior holds a lot of heat, even 4.6 billion years after the planet’s formation. For the first 1 billion to 1.5 billion years of Earth’s history, the planet’s insides were still too hot for the lithosphere to cool and thicken (SN Online: 9/21/17). That’s one necessary ingredient for modern plate tectonics, the ongoing collisions and separations of large “plates” of lithosphere, the jigsaw puzzle pieces that make up the hard outer shell of the planet.
Eventually the planet cooled enough for the crust to form. And then, around 3 billion years ago, Earth’s first continents arose. That ultimately added another key ingredient that allowed plate tectonics to get under way, geophysicist Stephan Sobolev and geologist Michael Brown argue in the June 6 Nature. Massive amounts of sediment scraped by glaciers off the continents were essential to kick off the lithospheric dance, the researchers say. That soft sediment was slowly deposited in deep ocean trenches, where it reduced the amount of friction between a sinking, or subducting, plate and the overlying plate, speeding up plate tectonics.
Giant influxes of sediment to the oceans, related to worldwide glaciation events such as an event that lasted from about 750 million to 630 million years ago, could explain why plate tectonics has sometimes kicked into a higher gear, Sobolev and Brown say. And a dearth of such sediments in the rock record could also explain periods of sluggish tectonic movement, including the boring billion, a period of lithospheric — and evolutionary — stability between 1.8 billion and 800 million years ago.
