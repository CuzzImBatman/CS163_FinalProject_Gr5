One of the pivotal figures in women’s MMA is set for a 2018 UFC Hall of Fame induction.

UFC officials Saturday announced that former champion Ronda Rousey (12-2 MMA, 6-2 UFC), who registered a record six consecutive title defenses of her women’s bantamweight belt from 2013-2015, will join its latest hall class. She’s part of the “Modern” wing, which honors fighters who turned pro after November 2000.

Rousey is the first female member of the UFC Hall of Fame.

“This is an immense honor, to not only take part in bringing women to the forefront of this sport, but now the UFC Hall of Fame,” Rousey said in a statement. “May I be the first of many.”

The 2018 UFC Hall of Fame induction ceremony takes place July 5 in Las Vegas and streams on UFC Fight Pass.

“There would be no women in UFC without Ronda Rousey,” UFC President Dana White stated. “Ronda is an absolute pioneer who helped me personally, and a lot of other people, look at women in combat sports differently. She accomplished everything she set out to do with UFC and became a global icon and role model in the process.”

Rousey, a 31-year-old judoka who won a bronze medal in the 2008 Olympics, eventually turned to MMA in 2010, and by 2012, she had won a Strikeforce title. After one title defense, she ushered female MMA into the UFC, where she was installed as the organization’s inaugural women’s 135-pound champion.

Rousey quickly became a mainstream and pay-per-view draw – and one of the most dominant champions the sport had ever seen. She opened her career with a 12-0 record with 12 stoppages. Eleven came in the first round – eight in a minute or less.

Rousey eventually left the UFC following back-to-back knockout losses to Holly Holm in 2015 and Amanda Nunes in 2016, and she’s now a pro-wrestling performer with the WWE.
