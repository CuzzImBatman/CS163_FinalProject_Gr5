Both Marvin Bagley III and Deandre Ayton are expected to hear their names called in the top 3 of Thursday’s NBA draft. They’ve already managed to make a major splash in the business side of basketball.

This week, it was announced that both Ayton and Bagley would sign with Puma as the company looks to build a basketball market. Puma has worldwide success in soccer and track, but the duo will be Puma’s first NBA signees since Vince Carter in 1998.

For Bagley, whose family had close ties to Nike, it was LaVar Ball who in-part inspired Bagley to reach this unconventional endorsement deal. He told Bleacher Report that he respected the mission of Big Baller Brand and that Puma offered a similar path.
