Nintendo's official reveal of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate was one of the biggest moments at E3 2018, and with the announcement that it will feature every character to ever be in Smash game, it looks pretty epic. It's no surprise then that the box art is also pretty impressive, with some classic Nintendo characters taking centerstage. Check it out below.
While not every one of the 66 confirmed characters is present, Nintendo has still done a pretty job of getting Mario, Link, Kirby, and some of our other favorites in there, all looking suitably ready for battle (especially Mario, who definitely came to fight with that facial expression). Nintendo has said that not all of the characters will be available at launch and hinted that the beginning line up may be a small as the original N64 game.
While most of the characters have been seen before in Smash, there will be mechanical changes and balances to them. Link's bombs can now be remotely detonated (a nod to Breath of the Wild), for example. All Final Smash moves will have more immediate effects; characters with long-lasting transformations like Bowser and Little Mac will have harder hitting versions that won't last as long. Some characters will also get cosmetic changes, like the Wii U Trainer, who will now have a new face.
Super Smash Bros. Ultimate will also feature two new characters, not seen in a Smash game before. Inking Girl (or Boy) from the Splatoon series will show up and so will Ridley, the archenemy of Samus Aran from the Metroid series. The game will be released on December 7, 2018, and will also support GameCube controllers and every previous Super Smash Bros. Amiibo.
