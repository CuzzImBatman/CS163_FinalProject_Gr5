Zion Williamson, in a cream-colored suit with a white shirt unbuttoned underneath, strolled from his stage right table to the podium and into the NBA when New Orleans selected him with the No. 1 overall draft pick, making official what everyone already knew since the Pelicans’ won the draft lottery.

A 6-foot-7, 285-pound battering ram with springs in his calves, Williamson was the consensus top choice after a dominant freshman season at Duke, averaging 22.6 points, 8.9 rebounds and 2.1 assists per game. He was college basketball’s player of the year.

Williamson will be the centerpiece of New Orleans’ rebuild, which begins in earnest with the team sending Anthony Davis to the Lakers in a deal expected to be completed on July 6.

The Pelicans, who acquired the fourth pick in their deal with the Lakers, moved that selection (and a late second-round pick) along with Solomon Hill to Atlanta for the No. 8, No. 17 and No. 35 selections in Thursday’s draft.

FIRST ROUND

No. 1 New Orleans Pelicans | Zion Williamson, Duke, PF, 6-7, 285

A generational talent who blends strength, speed and agility to beat stronger players off the dribble and smaller players with powerful moves. Only shot 33.8% from long range and 64% at the free-throw line in his one-and-done season with the Blue Devils.

No. 2 Memphis Grizzlies | Ja Morant, Murray State, PG, 6-3, 175

After two seasons in college, he’s proven to be an outstanding scorer and passer with incredible court vision. Needs to continue working on three-point shot. He improved from 29.2% accuracy as a freshman to 36.3% last season.

No. 3 New York Knicks | RJ Barrett, Duke, SG/SF, 6-7, 202

The versatile scorer — he can drive, pull up from mid-range or step back for a three-pointer — was the consensus third pick heading into the draft. Only part of his game that needs polishing is long-range shooting — 30.8% on threes last season.

No. 4 Atlanta Hawks (via Pelicans, Lakers) | De’Andre Hunter, Virginia, SF/PF, 6-7, 225

A top-notch defender with a solid shooting touch, he converted 52% of his shots from the field last season, including 43.8% from deep. The redshirt sophomore led the Cavaliers to a 66-5 record when healthy.

No. 5 Cleveland Cavaliers | Darius Garland, Vanderbilt, PG, 6-2, 175

This one-and-done former McDonald’s All-American only played four games in college but impressed by averaging 19.8 points while shooting 52.9% from the field and 47.8% from long range. Compared to Damian Lillard.

No. 6 Minnesota Timberwolves via Phoenix | Jarrett Culver, Texas Tech, SG, 6-6, 195

A strong two-way player, he averaged 18.5 points, 6.4 rebounds and 3.7 assists last season as a sophomore. Only lacking three-point consistency — converted just 30.4% of his long-range shots last season.

No. 7 Chicago Bulls | Coby White, North Carolina, PG/SG, 6-5, 185

At times a streaky shooter, this combo guard can score in a variety of ways, including from deep. He averaged 16.1 points, shooting 42% from the field and 35% from long range. Needs to improve his defense.

No. 8 New Orleans Pelicans via Atlanta | Jaxson Hayes, Texas, C, 6-11, 220

A 7-foot-3 wingspan gives him the potential to be a big-time rim protector. Averaged 2.2 blocked shots as a freshman last season, when he averaged 10 points a game while scoring a majority of times on dunks.

No. 9 Washington Wizards | Rui Hachimura, Gonzaga, SF/PF, 6-8, 230

This skilled combo forward is another talented two-way player who has a 7-foot-2 wingspan. He averaged 19.7 points and 6.5 rebounds as a junior last season. Needs to improve perimeter shot.

No. 10 Atlanta Hawks | Cam Reddish, Duke, SF, 6-8, 218

His seven-foot wingspan and athleticism make him a versatile wing. The Blue Devils’ third wheel is rough around the edges, particularly shooting — he converted only 35.6% of his shots from the field and 33.3% from deep.

No. 11 Phoenix Suns via Minnesota | Cameron Johnson, North Carolina, SF, 6-9, 210

A top-tier two-way talent because of his athleticism, he can space the floor. He shot 45.7% from long range as a senior, when he averaged 16.9 points, 5.8 rebounds and 2.4 assists.

No. 14 Boston Celtics | Romeo Langford, Indiana, SG, 6-6, 215

This one-and-done Hoosier has a ton of athleticism to go with his 6-foot-11 wingspan. His shooting slumped after a thumb injury but he averaged 16.5 points and 5.4 rebounds, only making 29.2% of his threes.

No. 15 Detroit Pistons | Sekou Doumbouya, France, PF, 6-9, 230

He’s 18 with plenty of two-way potential but needs to work on many aspects of his game. Ability to defend multiple positions, run the floor and score in variety of ways.

No. 16 Orlando Magic | Chuma Okeke, Auburn, 6-7, 235, SF/PF

A lanky, athletic two-way player who has a 7-foot wingspan. As a sophomore last season, he averaged 12.0 points and 6.8 rebounds while shooting 49.6% from the field and 38.7% from three-point range.

No. 17 New Orleans via Atlanta, Brooklyn | Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Virginia Tech, SG, 6-5, 205

No. 18 Indiana Pacers | Goga Bitadze, Georgia, C, 6-11, 245

No. 19 San Antonio Spurs | Luka Samanic, Croatia, PF, 6-10, 215

A skilled and versatile big man who played well at the NBA combine, he can handle the ball and shoot from the perimeter. Lacks the physicality at 19 to be a top defender or play in the post.

No. 23 Oklahoma City via Memphis and Utah | Darius Bazley, Princeton H.S., F, 6-9, 205

No. 24 Phoenix Suns | Ty Jerome, Virginia, G, 6-5, 195

A reliable combo guard on both ends of the court with a hard-nosed style of play. He averaged 13.6 points, 5.5 assists and 4.2 rebounds as a junior last season for the NCAA champions.

No. 27 CLIPPERS via Brooklyn | Mfiondu Kabengele, Florida State, F-C, 6-10, 250

No. 28 Golden State Warriors | Jordan Poole, Michigan, SG, 6-5, 195
