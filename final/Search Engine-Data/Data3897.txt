Impacts of dietary microalgae (Schizochytrium JB5) on growth performance, blood profiles, apparent total tract digestibility, and ileal nutrient digestibility in weaning pigs.
BACKGROUND:
Microalgae can serve as alternative to animal feed additive or supplement in the diet of weaning pigs to increase their potential and performance. Two experiments were done with 3 dietary treatments: CON (basal diet); MA1 (basal diet + 0.5% microalgae) and MA2 (basal diet + 1.0% microalgae). In experiment 1, 150 crossbred weaning pigs were used in a 5-week experiment. In experiment 2, 15 cannulated barrows were used. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of microalgae to determine the effects of dietary supplementation of microalgae Schizochytrium on growth performance, blood profiles, apparent total tract digestibility and ileal nutrient digestibility in weaning pigs.

RESULTS:
In experiment 1, pigs fed with MA2 had higher growth (P<0.05) than pigs fed with MA1 from day 8 to day 21, but, experimental result showed no significant effect (P>0.05) on growth performance, white blood cell, total cholesterol and triglyceride among the treatments. However, lymphocyte (%) of pigs fed with MA1 and MA2 diet was significantly higher (P<0.05) as compared to CON diet at day 35. In experiment 2, the apparent total tract digestibility and ileal nutrient digestibility of dry matter and nitrogen were higher (P<0.05) in pigs fed with MA1 and MA2 as compared to CON diet.

CONCLUSION:
Dietary microalgae supplementation has more dramatic and beneficial effects on nutrient digestibility than CON diet. It also increased lymphocyte concentration, but had no significant effect on growth performance in weaning pigs. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
