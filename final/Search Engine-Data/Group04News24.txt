Why wait for Prime Day? Save money on Amazon's luxury Kindle e-reader and Cloud Cam
The big sale starts in July. But the deep discounting has already begun.
We're less than a week away from July -- the month during which we expect Prime Day 2019 to fall. In fact, a leaked public relations email says the big sale will kick off this year on July 15. (Amazon didn't respond to our request for comment.)
We've already seen significant discounts on a variety of Amazon devices -- including Echo smart speakers, media streamers and Ring doorbells. And you haven't needed to be a member of Amazon's Prime service to take advantage of any of them.
Some of the low prices have evaporated in the wake of Father's Day. At the moment, the pickings are slim -- but there are worthwhile discounts on the 2017-version of the terrific Oasis e-reader and Amazon's excellent home security camera, which features free video clip storage for 24 hours. We expect to see more discounts appear during the run up to Prime Day 2019, however. So stay tuned.
Note that CNET may get a share of revenue from the sale of the products featured on this page.
Kindle Oasis e-reader (2017 version) -- save $50
The Kindle Oasis is the standard bearer for e-readers. It's slim, sturdy, waterproof and features a great 7-inch, high-resolution E Ink screen. Amazon just announced a new version, shipping on July 24, that lets you adjust the color tone depending on ambient light conditions but which is otherwise identical to older version that's currently on sale.
Note that Amazon has cut $50 from the price of the both the 8GB version and 32GB model, which now costs $230.
Amazon Cloud Cam -- save $30
Yes, it's affordable, reliable and easy to use -- but it's the free storage that ultimately gives Amazon's Cloud Cam an advantage over the home security competition. You get 24-hour video clip storage for free -- and if you want to extend the storage period to 7 days, Amazon's reasonable subscription starts at $7 per month.
