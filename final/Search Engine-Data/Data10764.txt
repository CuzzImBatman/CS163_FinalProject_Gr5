Spectators enjoying pre-match festivities outdoors should also keep an eye to the sky and move into a sealed vehicle or indoors as soon as thunder is heard. Remember that park pavilions are not a safe place to be during a thunderstorm.Otherwise, Roys anticipates temperatures to be around 26 C (79 F) at the start of the match and fall closer to 25 C (77 F) by the time the final whistle is blown.Temperatures can drop even lower with the passage of a shower or thunderstorm.Showers and thunderstorms are expected to dissipate later in the evening, allowing fans of the winning team to celebrate without the threat of lightning or need for rain gear.
