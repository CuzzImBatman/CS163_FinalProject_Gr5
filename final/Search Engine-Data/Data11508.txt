 OMAHA, Nebraska  (Reuters) - Maybe it takes a Warren Buffett to do a microphone check the way he did on Saturday morning: "Testing, 1 million, 2 million, 3 million." 

 Just after 7 a.m., ahead of the annual meeting of his Berkshire Hathaway Inc., the billionaire did his usual milling about a hall with booths featuring many of the more than 50 firms owned by his insurance and investment company. While shareholders shopped, wherever Buffett went, dozens of reporters and several camera crews were in tow. At the Justin Brands booth, Buffett picked up his ukulele to play and sing a song with The Quebe Sisters Band of Burleson, Texas. "I may well be looking for a new job fairly soon," the 76-year-old Buffett joked, alluding to the planning at Berkshire for when he steps down. "This will be my first audition. It may be my last audition," he said. "Watch for us on 'American Idol'." Then it was off to the Nebraska Furniture Mart display, where Buffett stretched out on a "Warren Plush" full-size bed marked down to $628.75 from $799.99. At the nearby Dairy Queen vendor, he bought a Vanilla Orange Bar. Finally, he went to the Fruit of the Loom shop where, as usual, he sang "If You Knew Susie" with the underwear company's mascots -- grown men dressed up as giant pieces of fruit. "What people dig about him is he comes across as a regular Joe," said Matt Geiler, an improvisational comedian from Omaha who wore the grapes costume. "We're just kind of the ambient music. Some people are here to listen to music, others just to buy underwear."
