“Jurassic World” fans better get ready to book their plane tickets, because a dinosaur-themed café is opening to commemorate the release of the latest film in Japan.

The restaurant, open for a limited time, will thrill food lovers and movie junkies alike with its unique and prehistoric looking food.

Diners with a raptor-like appetite will have the choice between three different entrees, as well as desserts and drinks, Movieweb reports.

The Jurassic World Burger, served on a black bun, comes with mushrooms, bacon and a side of fries.  The plate is even made to look like it has been scraped by a raptor.

The Volcano Curry, unsurprisingly, looks like a mountain exploding with lava, resting next to a salad, which resembles a jungle. There’s even a dinosaur resting on top.

The third entrée is the Powerful Wildplate, featuring raptor footprints across the dish.

The dessert menu also includes a large selection of movie-themed treats. The Fossil Excavation Cake comes with a brush, which diners can use to uncover edible dinosaur bones.

The Dinosaur Egg Cake, possibly the scariest of them all, looks like a baby dinosaur just getting ready to hatch. Good luck eating this dish while it is staring you down the entire time.

Drinks include Dinosaur Coffee Lattes, with a choice of an illustration of a T-Rex, Blue, or Mosasaurs printed on it.  There is also the Amber Jelly and Green Tea While Chocolate Smoothie, which features a “dinosaur egg” on top.
