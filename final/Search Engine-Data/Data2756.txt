Nintendo revealed a brand new Mario Party game for Switch during their Nintendo Direct E3 2018 Press Conference. It’s called Mario Party Super and the portable console has introduced some interesting new twists to some of the multiplayer mini-games.
The trailer showed a number of attractive young people playing Mario Party Super using two separate Switch consoles in handheld mode, Joy-Cons detached from both. With a battlefield map on both screens, they arranged the two consoles in a number of different configurations to create one map that connected between the two Switch consoles, and proceeded to have a four-player tank battle.
Another scene showed two couples camping out in the wilderness, playing a game that required them to set two Switch consoles back-to-back, and physically split up to whisper and strategize with each other. It’s then revealed that they’re playing a baseball game and they were strategizing on what kind of pitch to throw.
A quick montage shows a variety of other mini-games, some using Joy-Con button controls, and some using motion controls. Some variety of Bumper Balls seems to be back, and we saw games involving tennis, gridiron, photo-bombing, flying, frying a cube of Spam, horse-racing, and a tricycle racing game where you had to use the gyroscope to simulate peddling.
Finally, it was revealed that Super Mario Party will be available on October 8, 2018. For more news on Nintendo and everything else happening at E3 2018, check out all of GameSpot's coverage.
