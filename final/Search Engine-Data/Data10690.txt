What Oprah's Apple deal tells you about your next Apple subscription bill

LOS ANGELES – We know that Apple is bankrolling Hollywood stars such as Oprah to make TV shows for the iPhone distributor. We don't know when they will appear or in what form – could it be part of the existing Apple Music service or a new entertainment channel to take on Netflix and Amazon, perhaps?

Apple long has offered video-on-demand services, but it never has offered anything to rival Netflix or Hulu. Instead, it has directed viewers to its iTunes service, where they could buy and rent movies for viewing on computers, phones and via the Apple TV set-top box.

This à la carte service competes with YouTube and Amazon Video rentals. But so far, Apple doesn't offer monthly video streaming, which soaked up nearly $15 billion in consumer dollars in 2018, according to eMarketer. 

Instead, it's mostly focused on a monthly music subscription, Apple Music, which charges $9.99 monthly and boasts 50 million subscribers, second to No. 1 Spotify with 75 million subscribers.
