Surrey earthquake mystery: Monitors installed near fossil fuel drilling sites amid ‘extreme concern’ from locals
Around midday on 1 April, the calm of an Easter Sunday in leafy Surrey was shattered when locals began reporting explosions. Houses shook and windows rattled as the county experienced its first earthquake in at least 50 years.
Initially written off as a freak occurrence, the magnitude 2.7 tremors were the first of many. Seven earthquakes have been recorded in the region in the past four months, and experts still have no idea what is behind them.As seismologists scratch their heads, this “swarm” of earthquakes has flared tensions between oil companies intent on drilling the countryside and locals concerned the activity is making the very land they live on unstable.Surrey residents were quick to make the link between the earthquake epicentres and the close proximity of oil drilling operations.In the months that have followed, local politicians have joined with activist groups to express their “extreme concern” about a potential link between drilling and the region’s newfound seismic activity. Keith Taylor, Green MEP for the South East, has called for a moratorium on any fossil fuel extraction until scientists can demonstrate local drillers are not to blame. He says the worries of local people are completely understandable.“I think anyone would be concerned,” says Mr Taylor.“Extraction of unconventional energy has caused tremors in other places, including Blackpool, so it would be rather reckless of us to say ‘go on, carry on’.”But as far as scientists are concerned, the jury is out. While they suspect there is nothing suspicious about the earthquakes striking the southeast, there is also not enough evidence to conclude whether they are natural or man-made. To get to the bottom of this geological mystery, the British Geological Survey (BGS) has installed new earthquake monitors to pinpoint the precise origin of the tremors and settle the debate.“We hope to gain a better understanding of this scientific phenomena through the installation of additional stations,” said a BGS spokesperson.“We are unable to say categorically if these earthquakes are related to hydrocarbon exploration or production, mainly because of the uncertainties in our estimates of the earthquake epicentres and particularly depths.”The problem, they say, is that while reports have described the earthquakes as originating a few miles away from drilling sites like Horse Hill, current detectors are around 30 miles away. In reality, the inaccuracy of these estimates means the earthquakes could be a few miles further away, or a few miles closer. With the new detectors, they will be able to pinpoint the earthquake origins to within a few hundred metres.Opponents of the drilling operation are urging caution.James Hill, a Dorking resident and member of activist group A Voice For Leith Hill, says they are not claiming conclusively “one thing or the other”. “All we are saying is, because we don’t know, we think the sensible thing to do is to have these faults surveyed,” he says.But the oil and gas drillers are adamant that not only have their operations been risk-free, there is nothing “unconventional” about them.Fracking was temporarily banned in 2011 after it was blamed for earthquakes that struck Lancashire, but the drillers say they are not using any of these risky techniques.
