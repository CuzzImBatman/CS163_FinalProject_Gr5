Here's why airlines make you put your phone on 'Airplane Mode'
Ever wonder why you have to put your phone on "Airplane Mode" on flights? Most people think it's because active cell phones could interfere with the plane's navigation equipment. But that's not the real reason why your phone has to be in "Airplane Mode." Following is a transcript of the video.
Why airlines ask you to put your phone on "Airplane Mode."
Pilots claim that active cell phones could interfere with their navigation equipment.
"It's never been proven that a mobile phone signal has interfered with the navigation performance of the aircraft. But just because it's never happened doesn't mean it will never happen," a pilot tells Business Insider.
But the real reason airlines in the U.S. make you put your phone on "Airplane Mode" is because of the Federal Communications Commission.
FCC regulations ban the use of cell phones on planes in order to "protect against radio interference to cell phone networks on the ground." Meaning at 40,000 feet in the air, active cell phones would be picking up service from multiple cell towers on the ground. This could crowd the networks on the ground and disrupt service.
Some international airlines have cell phone receivers installed on select planes. So passengers on certain flights can call or text in the air. You can also connect to Wi-Fi on a lot of domestic flights. So you can surf the web and send messages. But most airlines restrict passengers from making calls over in-flight Wi-Fi.

But who makes phone calls these days anyway?
