Selena Gomez: Instagram 'would make me depressed'
Selena Gomez says she deleted Instagram from her phone because it made her feel "depressed".
Speaking ahead of the release of her new film, she said social media negatively affected her self-esteem.
The 26-year-old told Kelly Ripa and Ryan Seacrest, "it would make me feel not good about myself, and look at my body differently".
The singer added that despite having more than 152m Instagram followers, she doesn't go on it much.
"I used to use it a lot but I think it's become really unhealthy for young people, including myself, to spend all of their time fixating on all of these comments and letting this stuff in," she says.
Her comments come after she told audiences at Cannes Film Festival last month that she was scared of how social media could affect young people.
Selena said at the event she was worried by how much people were spending their lives online.
"It's a useful platform but it does scare me when you see young boys and girls not really aware of the news going on," she said.
"It's selfish - I don't wanna say selfish, that's rude - but it's dangerous for sure."
