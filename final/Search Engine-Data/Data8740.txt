CHEATERS NEVER PROSPER Fortnite virus disguised as aim bot hits almost 100,000 players
FORTNITE players are always looking for every advantage they can get--but this week some went too far and paid the price for it.
76,000 PC players who thought they, unlike England ace Harry Kane, needed some help finding the target downloaded a third-party app for Epic Games' shooter, and were hit with a nasty virus.
Lured in by the promise of free V-bucks and automatic aiming were hit with a nasty hack that took control of their computers and intercepted all their internet traffic.
The hack was spotted by streaming company Rainway thanks to errors it threw up for users who were hit and also running their software.
A little detective work on Rainway's part discovered the app was responsible for what is known as a 'man in the middle' attack.
The app installed a root certificate on the computers of anyone who installed it, giving it permission to change anything and everything on those gamers' computers with reckless abandon.

The most obvious change was it changing Windows' settings to route all web traffic through their own server on the way to the wider Internet.
That meant the nefarious hackers could then automatically change every single web page viewed by the infected users to include their own advertising code, potentially making a significant amount of money.
The nature of the attack also means that they could monitor all data being sent by those computers, collecting usernames, passwords, and anything else that those users did.
