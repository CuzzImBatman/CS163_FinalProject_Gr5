Fortnite Ragnarok Skin: See Season 5 Battle Pass's Awesome New Level 100 Reward
Valhalla, I am coming!

Fortnite Season 5 has kicked off with a distinctly historical theme. As we may have guessed from the Scandinavian axe teaser, Viking paraphernalia plays a big part in this season, including its biggest XP chase. The Legendary "Ragnarok" skin is the level 100 Battle Pass reward, but it also lets you customize your look as you upgrade it--provided you can unlock it in the first place.
Reaching level 100 is no easy feat in and of itself; Epic estimates it takes 75-150 hours to unlock everything the Battle Pass has to offer. Once you're there, you can accumulate XP to unlock six different styles, each adding another few pieces of armor or kit or facial hair as you progress. You begin as a tough-looking but otherwise standard warrior, and by the end you can dress up as a pretty terrifying specter.

You can check out the full range of looks above and let your envy at those final skins act as your encouragement to grind out the proper amount of XP. This season also introduces a host of other changes, including an All-Terrain Kart for transporting your crew, a bunch of new changes and additions to the map, motion controls on Switch, autofire on mobile, and more. A separate Drift skin also is also available through the Battle Pass with its own variety of looks from XP milestones. Be sure to check out our full roundup of the changes along with our challenge guide to grind out that Ragnarok XP.
