Pokemon Quest, the free-to-play Pokemon game featuring cube-shaped creatures, has reached a big new download milestone. The game has picked up more than 7.5 million downloads since it was released in May, the Pokemon Company has announced. The game is available on Nintendo Switch, as well as iOS and Android; it's free on all platforms.
It reached 1 million downloads in its first two days alone on Nintendo Switch, The Pokemon Company added. The company did not provide a breakdown of downloads between Nintendo Switch and the mobile editions.
Set on Tumblecube Island, Pokemon Quest features cube-style versions of the original 151 Pokemon, including Pikachu, Squirtle, Charmander, and Bulbasaur.
Like other free-to-play games, or, "free-to-start," as Nintendo calls them, Pokemon Quest is supported by microtransactions. You can pay real money to buy items and packs that help speed up your progress in the game. Download numbers are important for free-to-play games, but more important is how much money has come in from microtransactions.
As you would expect, The Pokemon Company has not shared any details about how much money Pokemon Quest has brought in. Independent research firm SensorTower recently reported that Pokemon Quest for iOS and Android made more than $3 million from microtransactions during its first week.
The next big Pokemon game is Pokemon: Let's Go Pikachu and Pokemon: Let's Go Eevee, which launch in November for Nintendo Switch. A "core" Pokemon RPG will follow in 2019. The hugely popular Pokemon Go continues to get new updates, too; the latest update added a version of Squirtle who wears sunglasses.
