London mayor approves baby Trump blimp to fly over city during visit

London's mayor has approved a request from protesters to fly a blimp designed to look like an infant President Trump during the president's visit to the United Kingdom next week.

Sky News reports that Sadiq Khan approved the request Thursday, allowing the blimp's owners to fly the 20-foot-tall float near Parliament between 9:30 a.m. and 11:30 a.m. local time on July 13, during a protest march scheduled in London at the same time.

"The Mayor supports the right to peaceful protest and understands that this can take many different forms," read a statement from the mayor's office obtained by Sky.

"His city operations team have met with the organisers and have given them permission to use Parliament Square Garden as a grounding point for the blimp."

Activist Leo Murray, a British citizen behind the orange "Trump Baby" float, told Sky that he was happy that the mayor's office had "rediscovered its sense of humor" in allowing the float to be displayed.

"We didn’t get off to the best start with the Mayor’s office over this, who originally told us that they didn’t recognize 'Trump Baby' as legitimate protest," he told Sky.

"But following a huge groundswell of public support for our plan, it looks like City Hall has rediscovered its sense of humor. Trump Baby will fly!”

Murray's fundraiser for the project on Crowdfunder had raised about $18,000 of its $23,000 stretch target, surpassing its initial goal and prompting Murray to announce a "world tour" for the float.

"We now plan to keep this crowdfunder rolling so that we can cover the shipping and helium costs to get #TrumpBaby to follow little Donald around the world, haunting his diplomatic engagements wherever he goes!" Murray wrote on the fundraiser page.

Trump is scheduled to visit the country for an official state visit next week.
