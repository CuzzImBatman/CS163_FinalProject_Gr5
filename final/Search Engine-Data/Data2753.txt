Cel-shaded mechs battle it out over a futuristic city in the reveal trailer for a new game, which kicked off Nintendo's official E3 2018 presentation. Set against a heavy metal soundtrack, giant mechs battle with little regard for the innocent buildings beneath them in Daemon X Machina.
The reveal during Nintendo E3 2018 presentation was light on details, but based on the gameplay shown, it looks like the game will include some kind of co-op aspect. However, whether that will be online or purely local remains to be seen. You can watch the devastating action above where two mechs take on enemy swarms and menacing bosses.
Daemon X Machina is a collaboration between developers Marvelous and First Studio, with an array of credited Japanese developers. It's set to release sometime in 2019, but to keep up with more of what Nintendo has in store for the Switch, you can check out our press conference news roundup here.
