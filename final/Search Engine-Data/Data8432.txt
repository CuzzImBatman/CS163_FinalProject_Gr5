The Surprising Origins of Hawaii's Feral Chickens
Genetic tests reveal where they came from.
THOUSANDS OF FERAL chickens inhabit Kauai, but their origin was long a mystery. Did they descend from red jungle fowl that Polynesians brought to Hawaii some 1,000 years ago or from farmed birds that flew the coop more recently? According to genetic tests, a mix of both, says biologist Eben Gering. Breeding these feral chickens with domestic ones could add welcome genetic diversity and make farm-raised fowl hardier, he says.
