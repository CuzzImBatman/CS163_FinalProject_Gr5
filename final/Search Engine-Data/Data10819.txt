Tyler Ulis and Devin Booker involved in elevator fight in 2017, per report
Former Kentucky Wildcats and Phoenix Suns teammates Devin Booker and Tyler Ulis were attacked during an elevator scuffle in 2017, according to TMZ.

The report says that Ulis was attacked on an apartment elevator in Tempe (AZ) on May 26, 2017. He was attempting to hold an elevator door open for his friends, but several other individuals tried to enter the elevator. Ulis attempted to block them from entering, which led to a scuffle and Ulis being put in a headlock before Booker eventually intervened in.

Ulis did throw punches, but Booker did not. Thankfully, it sounds like both of them came out of the incident with no injuries. No arrests were made either.

Both players went on to team up together with the Suns in the 2017-18 season, though Ulis has since been cut and is now looking for a new NBA home.

Booker has since signed a five-year max contract extension worth $158 million. I think it’s safe to think he can afford some good security for wherever he’s living now.
