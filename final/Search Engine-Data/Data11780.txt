A Norwegian Cruise Line crew member who fell overboard Saturday was miraculously found alive 22 hours later by a Carnival cruise ship.

The U.S. Coast Guard had been informed Saturday afternoon that a 33-year-old crew member was seen falling off of the Norwegian Getaway ship almost 30 miles northwest of Pinar del Rio, a province in western Cuba, according to The Miami Herald.

Following the report, the U.S. Coast Guard said, an HC-144 Ocean Sentry plane sent from Miami began the search just 10 minutes later.

But it was passengers aboard the Carnival ship who spotted the crew member around 1 p.m. Sunday, 21 miles north of Cuba.

The Norwegian employee, who has not been identified, was in stable condition. It was not immediately clear how the crew member managed to keep afloat after falling off the ship.

“This is nothing short of miraculous,” Christine Duffy, president of Carnival Cruise Line told the Miami Herald. “Kudos to the Carnival Glory team for this amazing effort to rescue a fellow seafarer.”

Carnival’s Glory left Miami on June 24 for an eight-day cruise that returned to the Florida city on July 1st. The Norwegian crew member was found on the final day of the cruise.
