Four-time NBA champion Shaquille O'Neal thinks LeBron James' legacy as a "legend" and one of the greatest players of all-time is already solidified. The Hall of Famer said James' three NBA titles are enough. 

"Somebody told me a long time ago, they said your book is already set. You can add index pages toward the end, but your book is already set. So LeBron's book is already set," O'Neal told ESPN on Friday. "He done already passed up legends; he done already made his mark — he has three rings. His mentality now is probably: I want to get four before (Golden State Warriors guard) Steph (Curry) does. That's probably his mentality now.

"But if I was him, I wouldn't be trying to get four, five and six because it ain't going to matter. It's just something else to talk about, something else to add to the pages. He's a legend, talked about as who is the best between he and Michael Jordan, so he's set."
O'Neal, a former teammate of James' for one season with the Cleveland Cavaliers towards the end of his career, likened James' career twilight to his own. O'Neal won three NBA titles with the Los Angeles Lakers before winning one more with the Miami Heat. Then he closed out his career as a journeyman in search of one final championship. 

"My problem toward the end of my career was I was trying to shut everybody up and I was greedy (for more championships)," O'Neal said. "After I got to three (titles), everybody was saying I couldn't get another. So I got four. After I got the fourth, they were saying I couldn't get another one. So I was trying to make quick stops to get it. Phoenix, Cleveland, Boston."

O'Neal also added that it will be "difficult" for James to unseat the Golden State Warriors from their reign over the sport — wherever he goes — with the defending champs having won three of the last four NBA titles and two in a row since Kevin Durant bolstered their star power.
