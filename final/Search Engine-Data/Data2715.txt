$175 Overwatch Hanzo Statue Available For Pre-Order
A minor setback.

Blizzard's latest addition to its line of premium Overwatch statutes is Hanzo, the bow-wielding assassin. The first wave of Hanzo statues is scheduled to ship sometime before the end of Q4 2018, but it's not cheap. You can pre-order it now for $175 (limit 10 per customer).
But that price tag begins to make sense when you look at the close-up photos Blizzard has released. This 13-inch statue is hand-painted with intricate detail. It features the nimble archer nocking an arrow into his bow, with his scarf billowing behind him.
Hanzo isn't the first $175 statue Blizzard has made available to Overwatch fans. Similarly sized Tracer, Genji, Widowmaker, and Reaper statues are available now, and a Mercy statue is scheduled to release by the end of Q4 this year.
Nor is $175 the only price point for Overwatch collectibles on the Blizzard Gear Store. You can buy Overwatch Figma figures for $80 each, Nendoroids for $50, or Funko Pops for $10 (the D.Va Funko Pop is "super-sized" and costs $25). If you're looking to unload even more money, you can go all out and buy a 20-inch D.Va statue for $450. There's also an assortment of Overwatch shirts, leggings, and scarves available.
In other recent Overwatch news, Blizzard raised $12.7 million for breast cancer research by selling a pink Mercy skin and a special t-shirt. Disney and Blizzard have also struck a deal to broadcast the Overwatch League playoffs on Disney channels, like ESPN and Disney XD.
