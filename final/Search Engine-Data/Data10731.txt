A report surfaced Friday that the Phoenix Suns would explore the possibility of trading the No. 1 pick in Thursday’s NBA draft for the San Antonio Spurs' Kawhi Leonard.

There is no truth to the report. In fact, the Suns have no interest in dealing the top pick — which likely will be Arizona center Deandre Ayton — in exchange for Leonard, who reportedly wants to be traded.

From the Suns’ standpoint, the trade makes little sense. Leonard will be a free agent after the upcoming 2018-19 season. Phoenix would risk trading its most valuable asset for a player who might not be around for more than one year.

Phoenix could try to convince Leonard to sign a five-year contract extension, but why would Leonard sign long-term with a team that has missed the playoffs eight straight seasons? Also, most NBA observers believe Leonard is determined to hit free agency so he can choose his team.
It’s unlikely the Suns have enough other assets to satisfy the Spurs. Reports have said San Antonio will seek young players with star potential, and the only two players on Phoenix’s roster that fit that criteria are Devin Booker, who is untouchable, and Josh Jackson. But, again, consider the risk: Is trading Jackson worth possibly having Leonard for just one season?

Phoenix could be involved in a Leonard deal, however, as a third team facilitator. Leonard reportedly has expressed interest in playing for the Los Angeles Lakers, and the Lakers have enough young assets to potentially satisfy the Spurs. Phoenix could get involved by taking Luol Deng’s contract off the Lakers’ hands — he has two years and $36 million left on his deal — in exchange for one of Los Angeles’ young players, say, for example, point guard Lonzo Ball.

This much is certain: The Suns will not trade their No. 1 pick for Leonard.
