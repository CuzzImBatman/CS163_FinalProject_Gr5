 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average rose to yet another record close on Friday as investors snapped up shares of Altria Group Inc. ( MO.N ) after a court decided to review a multibillion-dollar case involving the company's cigarette-making unit. 

 The jump of nearly 2 percent in Altria's stock propelled the Dow  .DJI  to its 18th record close since the start of October and helped underpin the S&P 500's finish above the 1,400 mark for the first time in six years. Even so, concerns about signs of further weakness in the housing market restrained a broader market advance and overshadowed the boost from a second straight day of declines in crude oil prices, which helped industrial stocks such as 3M Co. ( MMM.N ). New housing starts dropped 14.6 percent in October to their lowest in more than six years while building permits fell 6.3 percent, the U.S. Commerce Department said.   "It was a pretty bad number," said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey. "Housing cuts through the economy. If housing is going to slow more, than all the rest of the sectors that support it are going to struggle." The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  rose 36.74 points, or 0.30 percent, to finish at a record close of 12,342.56, which also marked its session high and a lifetime high. The Dow notched a sixth straight session of gains, its longest winning streak in a year. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  gained 1.44 points, or 0.10 percent, to end at 1,401.20. But the Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  slipped 3.20 points, or 0.13 percent, to close at 2,445.86. For the week, the Dow rose 1.9 percent and the Nasdaq jumped 2.4 percent -- marking a second straight week of gains for both. The S&P 500 finished the week up 1.5 percent. Altria shares rose 1.7 percent, or $1.44, to $85.01 on the New York Stock Exchange after a federal appeals court decided to review a lower court ruling that let a $200 billion lawsuit filed by "light" cigarette smokers proceed as a class action, according to a court document. The appeals court also stopped proceedings in the suit, involving Marlboro cigarette maker Philip Morris USA, a unit of Altria.   OIL SLIDES BELOW $56 The drop in crude oil prices helped shares of industrial conglomerates such as diversified manufacturer 3M, the maker of Scotch tape and Post-It notes, whose stock gained 1.4 percent, or $1.11, to $81.40 on the NYSE. 3M was the Dow's second-biggest advancer, behind Altria. U.S. crude oil futures ended lower but managed to pare losses to end near $56 a barrel after falling to a 17-month low in overnight electronic trading. NYMEX crude for December delivery CLZ6, which expired at the close, settled at $55.81 a barrel, down 45 cents. During earlier electronic trading, the NYMEX December crude contract dropped as low as $54.86, the lowest since June 14, 2005. TOUGH TIMES FOR HOME BUILDERS Shares of home builders such as Beazer Homes USA Inc. ( BZH.N ) fell after the housing data. Beazer's shares dropped 1.8 percent, or 82 cents, to $44.07, while shares of Lennar Corp. ( LEN.N ), another U.S. home builder, slipped 0.12 percent, or 6 cents, to $49.34. Both trade on the NYSE. Fears that computer and printer maker Hewlett-Packard Co. ( HPQ.N ) could struggle to keep posting strong profits also kept investors on edge, limiting gains among technology shares. Hewlett-Packard's stock fell 1 percent, or 39 cents, to $39.77 and was among the biggest drags on both the Dow and the S&P 500. The company also disclosed that securities regulators had elevated an investigation into the company's probe of boardroom leaks.   The biggest drag on the Nasdaq was Starbucks Corp. ( SBUX.O ), the world's largest coffee shop chain. Starbucks shares fell 5.1 percent, or $2.01, to $37.42, a day after it posted a drop in quarterly profit and revenue missed estimates. Volume was active on the NYSE, where about 1.70 billion shares changed hands, above last year's daily average of 1.61 billion. On the Nasdaq, about 1.79 billion shares were traded, slightly below last year's daily average of 1.80 billion. Decliners narrowly outnumbered advancers on the NYSE, where 1,735 stocks fell and 1,566 shares rose. On the Nasdaq, the negative breadth was more pronounced, with 1,741 stocks falling and 1,275 shares rising.
