Bill Gates says Microsoft losing to Android was his 'greatest mistake'
Microsoft's co-founder said his company missed out on $400 billion after letting Google create the "standard non-Apple phone platform."
Bill Gates admitted his "greatest mistake ever" was failing to put Microsoft in Android's position as the world's biggest "non-Apple" mobile operating system. The Microsoft co-founder reflected the era when the market was shifting towards mobile in an interview at venture capital firm Village Global.
"In the software world, particularly for platforms, these are winner-take-all markets. So the greatest mistake ever is whatever mismanagement I engaged in that caused Microsoft not to be what Android is. That is, Android is the standard non-Apple phone platform. That was a natural thing for Microsoft to win," he said.
"It really is winner take all. If you're there with half as many apps or 90% as many apps, you're on your way to complete doom. There's room for exactly one non-Apple operating system and what's that worth? $400 billion that would be transferred from company G to company M."
He suggested that Microsoft being distracted by an antitrust lawsuit was a factor in Google (which has its own antitrust problems now) having the chance to get into the mobile market. The search giant released Google released Android a decade ago and it has over two billion monthly active users, more than double the number of Windows 10 users, our sister site ZDNet noted.
Steve Ballmer, who succeeded Gates as CEO in 2000 and retired in 2014, once admitted that his biggest mistake was letting Google dominate the search market. So current CEO Satya Nadella better watch the search giant very closely indeed.
