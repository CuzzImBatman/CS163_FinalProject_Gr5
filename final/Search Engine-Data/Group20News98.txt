Gameplay
The gameplay of PewDiePie's Tuber Simulator mockingly simulates the life of a YouTuber, with modes similar to PewDiePie himself. The player creates videos which generate views, a currency used to purchase items from the store as to decorate the player's room. The creation of videos also allows the player to gain YouTube subscribers, essential for the unlocking of select features and achievements. Achievements can be obtained by completing a specific task, with the reward of views and subscribers, as well as other goods. The player may also use bux to purchase special items such as clothing or to increase the size of the player's room. Brains can be used to unlock extra features such as additional delivery slots. A minigame called Puggle is also accessible, reminiscent of pachinko, which can be used to speed up delivery processes and gain other goods. A series of user-wide competitions are also available for the player to partake in, each with a theme to match entered rooms. Entry into a competition costs five bux.

Reception
Of the game, Rolling Stone commented that PewDiePie's Tuber Simulator "has more in common with Kim Kardashian: Hollywood than Game Dev Story" and that "I wasn't sure if I was playing a game or being integrated into a human milking machine". Touch Arcade rated the game at four out of five stars, stating that "with some rather simple yet intricate and absorbing gameplay, coupled with PewDiePieÅfs signature humor and charm that is bound to go down well with his millions of die-hard fans, the game strikes a perfect balance between not taking itself seriously while being intriguing enough to keep interest long after the first cardboard box has been bought.".
