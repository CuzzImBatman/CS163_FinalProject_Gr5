The High Risk Places in America for Global Warming Flooding
On one hand, living near the sea has a host of obvious advantages. You can walk to the beach, soak in unparalleled ocean views from your balcony, or maybe even take up a coastal hobby like boating or surfing.On the other hand, your house could flood or be demolished entirely by nature. Hurricanes, tidal waves, and tropical storms have long made living by the beach almost as risky as it is pleasurable.But with global warming and the long documented trend of rising sea levels, there’s a new risk for owning a home by the sea: your plot of land will simply become part of the seascape and never be habitable again.With some of the most populated and desirable locations in America located near the sea, just how many people will be displaced when the sea levels rise?We decided to analyze data from Priceonomics customer Gavop, an insurance data and research company, how many people in America live near the sea to see where devastation from rising sea levels will be the greatest. We started with the United States Census data on coastal tracts of land, and calculated which of these zones were most populated in areas likely to be vulnerable to rising sea levels. We also looked at how much homes cost in these zones and how much home insurance premiums cost.The state with the most people living in coastal zones susceptible to rising sea levels is Florida, where almost 1.8 million people live near the water. The US cities most at risk to global flooding are New York, Seattle and San Francisco, the nerve centers of the financial and technology industries.However, the two areas with the most expensive properties that are at risk to rising sea levels are both in Connecticut: Riverside and Darien are both high risk zones where the median home costs almost $2 million. Lastly, though homeowners insurance does not typically cover flooding, comparable home owners insurance is much more expensive closer to the sea, especially in Texas.
