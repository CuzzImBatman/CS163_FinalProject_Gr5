Silicon Valley could help the last people you'd expect — and Elon Musk has given $15 million to a contest that will prove it
One of the greatest insights Peter Diamandis ever had was that one of the best ways to inspire people to create societal progress is through a contest with a cash prize.
Diamandis is the serial entrepreneur founder of the XPRIZE Foundation, and he recently spoke with us for Business Insider's podcast "Success! How I Did It."
It was 1993 and he was reading Charles A. Lindbergh's autobiography "The Spirit of St. Louis" during a visit to his parents' house. He learned that Lindbergh was motivated to become the first aviator to cross the Atlantic by a $25,000 prize. "And Lindbergh, the most unlikely guy, pulls it off and becomes massively famous — and opens up aviation, more importantly," Diamandis said.
It inspired him to set out on a journey to inspire a similar path to launching the first private manned flight into space, a feat he saw realized in 2004. Since then, the XPRIZE Foundation has had seven successful contests and eight current ones, inspiring several businesses to tackle "moonshots" that companies would otherwise find too risky to be worth the attempt.
SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been funding one of the current contests, the $15 million Global Learning XPRIZE, since 2014, and its winner will be announced in April 2019. Diamandis explained to us that it is an ideal example of how the private sector can tackle some of the world's greatest challenges, like the prize's goal of finding an elegantly simple and cost-effective way of wiping out illiteracy, a condition that Musk called "the wellspring of poverty."
