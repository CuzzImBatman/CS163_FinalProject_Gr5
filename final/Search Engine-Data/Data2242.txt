Andy Murray to play Wimbledon doubles after career-saving operation

After coming back from the verge of retirement at the Australian Open, three-time grand slam champion Andy Murray is enjoying his tennis again.
Alongside Feliciano Lopez at Queen's Club, the Scot won his first doubles match since a career-saving hip operation six months ago and now has his sights set on success at Wimbledon.
Murray confirmed he would be partnering up with France's Pierre-Hugues Herbert at the grass-court major and was looking forward to the challenge.
Herbert has won all four grand slam doubles titles and, like Murray in the singles in 2016, clinched victory at Wimbledon that year, partnering with Nicolas Mahut.
"He (Herbert) had said to my coach he wasn't going to be playing doubles at Wimbledon. He was going to concentrate on singles at the French Open and Wimbledon," said Murray.
"And then, I can't remember exactly how long, but a couple of weeks ago, [he] got in touch. I'm assuming he spoke with his team and thought it might be a nice thing to do."
