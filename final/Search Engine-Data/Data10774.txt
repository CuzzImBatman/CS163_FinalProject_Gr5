“Coral reefs are in crisis, and we need to have all options available.”
The project  is called the Marine Ecological Research Management Aid, or MERMAID. It’s an online and offline app that lets scientists easily input data that they would otherwise have to enter by hand into a spreadsheet. “This lets scientists, at the click of a button, download a clean datasheet to use for analysis and reporting," Darling said.It will also include a dashboard showing all of the locations around the world where scientists have input data into the program—researchers will have the option to include just their contact information and no data, a summary of their data, even their complete data.That range of options is key, to support and incentivize collaboration in the race to save the coral reefs from dying, Darling said.. It also lets scientists across the world follow and identify which interventions that are working. “ saves scientist time, so that they can report whether their conservation efforts are making a difference,” she said.  While MERMAID will be customizable to the needs of individual scientists, it has enough standardization to make it easier to conduct large-scale analysis of multiple projects at once. That process normally requires exhaustive data cleaning—which can take years.  “Myself and some other colleagues have been leading a global synthesis, and it took three years to compile the data,” Darling said. “That’s time the reefs do not have.”But with MERMAID, Darling said, all the data will already be in the same architecture, and with the same metadata.Right now, testers in Fiji, Indonesia, and Papua New Guinea are piloting the software. Darling said that they’re hoping to launch the beta version of MERMAID by the end of July.“When we talk to potential users, people want this to be done now. They wish they had it ten years ago,” she said.
