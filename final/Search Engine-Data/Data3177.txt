Roger Federer was at his self-deprecating best when he tweeted how his wife feels about him returning to pro tennis

Roger Federer cracked a joke that left his fans on Twitter in stitches.
The 20-time Grand Slam tennis champion returns to competition on Wednesday after three months away from the sport.
Federer was asked on Tuesday how his wife felt about him competing once again, and he joked that she was just happy to have him out of the house.
Roger Federer was at his self-deprecating best when he tweeted about how his wife felt about him returning to competitive tennis.

The 20-time Grand Slam champion has not played a match since his second-round loss to Thanasi Kokkinakis in March. Federer skipped the clay season so he could be as fit and as fresh as possible for the Wimbledon Championships, a tournament he has won a record eight times. He returns to the court at the Stuttgart Open, taking on Germany's Mischa Zverev on Wednesday.

You would imagine that during his time away from the sport, Federer would stick to his diet plan and train hard to ensure he remains at the top of his game.

But when the 36-year-old was asked by a fan on Tuesday how his wife, Mirka Federer, felt about his return to competition
Federer, renowned for his James Bond looks, confessed in a recent interview with GQ that he was not as big a style icon as everybody believes.

In fact, it may well be the opposite — he recalled an "embarrassing" wardrobe malfunction at a Wimbledon event in 2007.

Federer said he was so excited about winning that he forgot how to dress and put his trousers on the wrong way, and he didn't realize until it was too late.

"As I put my hands in my pockets, I realise that the pockets are going backwards," he told GQ. "I was like: 'It's too late! I can't change them anymore!' I lifted the trophy, and the pants were on backwards.

"You could hardly see it, but I think one British media picked it up and were like: 'What's going on? He's got the zipper at the back.'"
