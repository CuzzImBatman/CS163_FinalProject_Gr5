'Police called' as Build-A-Bear teddy sale sparks chaos
A teddy bear offer has been abandoned amid "safety concerns" after it sparked chaos in shopping centres across the UK.
Build-A-Bear launched its first ever "pay your age day", with parents able to buy a teddy costing their child's age in pounds.
Police had to be called to the White Rose Centre, Leeds, after a queue of "around a mile long" caused unrest, the Yorkshire Evening Post reported.
Paul Shaw, who was at the shopping centre, posted on Facebook: "Crazy scenes at the White Rose... Build-A-Bear is in chaos.
"Queuing from the store, all the way outside, approximately five-hour queue, no guarantee of even getting one.
"Security are going mental and there are even police here trying to keep the peace."

A shopper at the Meadowhall centre in Sheffield claimed Build-A-Bear told her to expect a "nine-hour wait" because of the length of the queue.
Kirsty L McNeil wrote on Facebook: "Build a bear queue is insane at Meadowhall.
"They've capped it at a predicted nine-hour wait."
