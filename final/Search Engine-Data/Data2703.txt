Fortnite Battle Pass Rewards: New Skins, Emotes, Sprays, And More For Season 5
So many unlocks, so little time.

The Battle Pass for Season 5 of Fortnite is now available and it's got a whole load of new rewareds for players to work towards unlocking. For those unfamiliar with it, the Battle Pass is available to purchase in-game for 950 V-Bucks and can be leveled up by playing the game. As you level up the pass, new items are unlocked, and there are around 100 rewards which, according to developer Epic Games, "typically takes between 75 to 150 hours of play" to unlock. We've got a complete rundown on how the Battle Pass works.
When you purchase a Battle Pass, you'll immediately get access to the Drift and Huntress skins, as well as some XP bonuses. Beyond that there are emotes, gliders, loading screens, sprays, skins, back bling, contrails, and more to unlock. There are also weekly challenges, which you can learn more about in our Fortnite Season 5, Week 1 Challenges guide. A new feature included in the Battle Pass is Toys, which are described as "new ways for you and your squad to have fun on the island. Try out your jumpshot on the court, see if you can make a hole in one, or just enjoy some beach ball bouncing in the sand before the storm arrives." You'll earn these Toys by reaching certain Battle Pass tiers.
If you're looking for a complete breakdown of everything that the update adds and changes, check out the Fortnite Season 5 patch notes. Highlights include a brand-new vehicle called the All-Terrain Kart, a couple of new map areas, as well as the desert biome. There's also a new feature called Rifts; by walking into one, you'll be teleported high up into the air.
Take a look at everything in the new Fortnite Season 5 Battle Pass below. You'll have until Season 5 ends in September to unlock everything; certain rewards are obtainable for all players for free, but the majority of it--including the most desirable things, such as free V-Bucks and the Ragnarok skin--will require you to purchase the Battle Pass. Fortunately, if you play enough, you'll more than make back the V-Bucks you spend on it.
