Massive volcanic eruption captured from space in 'spectacular' image

A volcano off a remote Russian peninsula has erupted for the first time in nearly 100 years - and was captured on camera from space in a "spectacular" photograph.

Astronauts on the International Space Station snapped a towering mushroom-shaped cloud of ash and smoke rising up from the 700-metre-wide crater of the Raikoke Volcano on the Kuril Islands.

The islands are an archipelago of volcanic peaks that lies between Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula and Japan's Hokkaido Island.

The last time the Raikoke Volcano on the small, oval-shaped uninhabited island erupted was in 1924.

On 22 June this year, a plume again went up into the air reaching an altitude of around 43,000ft (eight miles).

It also spread east as it was pulled into the circulation of a storm in the North Pacific Ocean.

Volcanologist Simon Carn said: "What a spectacular image.

"The ring of white puffy clouds at the base of the column might be a sign of ambient air being drawn into the column and the condensation of water vapour.

"Or it could be a rising plume from interaction between magma and seawater because Raikoke is a small island and flows likely entered the water."

A second image from NASA's Terra satellite showed the most concentrated ash was on the western edge of the plume, above Raikoke island.

A third image, based on data from the Suomi NPP satellite, showed the plume a few hours later.

After an initial surge of activity that included several distinct explosive pulses, activity subsided and strong winds spread the ash across the Pacific.

By the next day, just a faint remnant of the ash remained visible to the Terra satellite.
