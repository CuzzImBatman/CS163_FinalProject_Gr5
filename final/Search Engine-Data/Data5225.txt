A new trailer reveals that Dead Cells is leaving Early Access and officially launching on August 7. That same day, the game will also release on Xbox One, PS4, and Nintendo Switch. Dead Cells has already sold nearly a million copies since its Early Access release on PC in May 2017.
Dead Cells is an action-platformer inspired by titles like Metroid and Castlevania. The title also features rogue-lite elements, like permadeath, and has proven to be a punishingly difficult game. Dead Cells is launching with 13 levels, four bosses, over 80 different weapons and skills, and four special powers. The new trailer details a few of the environments the player will traverse, as well as the enemies and bosses that they'll have to kill on their journey. Most of the special powers and many of the weapons and skills make an appearance in the trailer too.
You can pre-order Dead Cells right now, unless you're hoping to grab the title on Nintendo Switch. Switch pre-orders open up on July 18. If you're grabbing the game on console, pre-ordering is the way to go. There's a 20% discount on all console pre-orders, which knocks the U.S. price down to $20.
Dead Cells launches on August 7 for Xbox One, PS4, PC, and Nintendo Switch. If you need more information before buying the game, listen to us discuss on The Lobby why players should care about Dead Cells. If you want to see Dead Cells in action, watch our Let's Play of the game.
