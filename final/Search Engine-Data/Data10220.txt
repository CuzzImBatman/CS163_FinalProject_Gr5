Ridley from the Metroid series made a dramatic entrance into Super Smash Bros. Ultimate during Nintendo's E3 2018 presentation. On top of that, he's getting the royal treatment with his very own Amiibo figurine. Nintendo showed off the figure during its Nintendo Treehouse stream following the main presentation.
The Ridley Amiibo was flanked by a new model of the Inkling Girl, and two mystery spots. One of those spots is reserved for Daisy, who will be an echo character for Peach. That leaves one more Amiibo character yet to be revealed, possibly pending another new character announcement.
Nintendo announced during its stream that all previous Amiibo will be compatible with Smash Bros. Ultimate. You can train them up just like you did in the Wii U and 3DS versions, and your existing training data is transferable to Ultimate.
These four characters are getting the celebrity treatment, but the game has lots more to choose from: every character to have appeared in any Smash Bros. game to be exact. Smash Bros. Ultimate is coming on December 7.
