France dismantled Croatia today to win the World Cup in Russia. French striker Antoine Griezmann put his side ahead 2-1 after knocking in a penalty kick. He celebrated the big goal by performing the brutal and humiliating Fortnite "Take the L" dance.
This is where the player makes an "L" shape with their hand on their face and then kicks their feet to each side in a brutal dance of humiliation and rudeness. You can see Griezmann perform the dance in the video below from FOX Soccer. He has it down pretty well, which is no surprise when you recall that he also did the dance after scoring a goal against Argentina earlier in the tournament.
This is not the first time we've seen professional athletes do Fortnite celebrations, but this is different. In all of sport, there is no bigger stage than the World Cup Final, so what a strange timeline we are in that a free-to-play battle royale game is showing up there.
France ended up winning 4-2, and you can see more coverage of the event at GameSpot sister site CBS Sports. With the NFL season kicking off next month, we can only imagine there will be Fortnite touchdown celebrations all the time, so look out for that.
Fortnite's Season 5 began last week--and it's a big deal. The update changed the map significantly--among other things, it added a new area--while the storm circle now operates differently. There is also a new Battle Pass you can buy with cosmetic items and other nice benefits. Check out GameSpot's Season 5 coverage here to learn more about what's new.
