It's a good time to stop by the local GameStop or head to the website, because between now and July 15 the retailer is running its annual summer sale. This year you can find lots of good deals on games, consoles, and accessories for PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch. The main difference between this sale and GameStop's regular weekly sale is quantity. A lot more games are on sale now than usual, even if the sale prices are about the same as you'd find any other week. At any rate, let's dive in and see what kind of money we can save during this year's GameStop summer sale.
On the hardware side, if you buy a 1TB Xbox One console, you'll get a $50 GameStop gift card for free. The green and gray Xbox One wireless controller is available for 20% off, bringing it down to $52. PS4 owners can grab a gold or magma red DualShock 4 controller for $55, saving $10 in the process.

In terms of games, you can grab the shooters Call of Duty: WWII or Far Cry 5 for $40 each. Destiny 2 is down to $10, while Star Wars Battlefront II is currently available for $20. And if you're looking forward to Fallout 76, you can tide yourself over with Fallout 4: Game of the Year Edition, which comes with all the DLC for that open-world shooter.
Other highlights include The Witcher III: Wild Hunt Complete Edition on sale for just $20, giving an impressive amount of bang for your buck. Monster Hunter World is another game you can play for hundreds of hours; it's on sale for $30. The same goes for Grand Theft Auto V, which is currently $20.
