 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - The Walt Disney Co said on Thursday its studio division generated $3.26 billion in global box office revenue in 2006 and claimed the year's top two box office and top three DVD domestic releases for the first time. 

 The performance marks a turnaround for the studio, whose performance lagged that of Disney's other three business units up until the release of "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest" and Disney-Pixar's "Cars" last summer. Walt Disney Studios Chairman Dick Cook reorganized the division in July, sharply cutting its film output and reducing its work force by 20 percent, to focus on family franchises like its two "Pirates" films and "The Chronicles of Narnia." Disney said it claimed the year's top-grossing box office releases with "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest", which has reached $1.06 billion since its May release, and the computer-animated "Cars," which grossed more than $462 million globally. Buena Vista Worldwide Home Entertainment, Disney's home entertainment arm, had the three top-selling DVDs in the domestic market with "Pirates," "Cars" and "The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe," Disney said. "Pirates" sold 10.5 million DVDs in the first week after its December 5 release but more current sales figures were not immediately available, the company said. "Cars," released November 7, has sold more than 13 million DVDs, and "Narnia," released in April, has surpassed more than 12 million DVDs sold, both as of early December.
