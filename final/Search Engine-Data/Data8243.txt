CLEVELAND – Should he stay or should he go? Will he stay or will he go?

Those questions will be discussed over and over until LeBron James decides in early July where he wants to play next season.

James has until June 29 to opt out of the final year of his contract with the Cleveland Cavaliers – which he is expected to do – and become a free agent.

Cleveland can offer James a five-year deal worth nearly $209 million, and other teams can offer him a four-year deal worth about $150 million. There’s no guarantee James signs a deal that long. He has signed short-term deals since returning to the Cavs and may do so again to keep options open.

Another consideration: There are three teams with realistic salary cap space to sign James in free agency: Cleveland, Philadelphia and Los Angeles Lakers. Any other team will have to commit extreme salary cap gymnastics or convince the Cavaliers a sign-and-trade is worth their while.
