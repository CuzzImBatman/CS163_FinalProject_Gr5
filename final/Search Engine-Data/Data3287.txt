For fans who have closely watched the growth of MMA, it’s always been clear that the quality of the sport will always rise when the level of athletes competing is at its highest.

In the U.S., NFL players are widely considered to be among the biggest, strongest and fastest athletes in sport today. And while there has been some minor crossover between professional football and MMA – big-show veterans such as Matt Mitrione and Brendan Schaub chiefly among them – there hasn’t exactly been a rush of NFL talent making its way to combat sports.

On Tuesday, NFL veterans Greg Hardy (75 games played) and Austen Lane (30 games played) meet at Dana White’s Contender Series 9, which takes place in Las Vegas at The Ultimate Fighter Gym and streams live on UFC Fight Pass. The two fighters are among 10 athletes hoping to land a UFC deal by impressing UFC President Dana White with their performance.
Hardy (0-0) has garnished the most attention. While he’s impressed in a perfect amateur run, he now makes his professional debut ostensibly just one fight away from a UFC deal. Hardy also comes with baggage, after previously being convicted of a misdemeanor following a domestic violence incident, though the charges were later dropped on appeal.

Meanwhile, Lane (4-0) has finished all four of his professional opponents to date. While he’s not a former All-Pro like Hardy, Lane started 17 games for the Jacksonville Jaguars.

But are these two ready for the UFC?
