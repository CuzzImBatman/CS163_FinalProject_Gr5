iPhone 11 could be £300 more expensive than today’s top Apple smartphones, experts warn
That's the warning from one expert who thinks the US-China trade war could see Apple's production costs spiralling out of control.
The majority of Apple's gadgets are made in China, but the trade war means Apple may be forced to move production elsewhere.
And this, experts think, could see Apple paying more to manufacture iPhones in the short term.
This could see the cost of the rumoured iPhone 11 – due out in September – rising by hundreds of pounds.
According to Coates, big shifts in production don't "just happen with the snap of a finger".
She added: "Almost no place can match the manufacturing might of China at the moment."
The expert analyst warned that such moving away from China could increase Apple's manufacturing costs by 30%.
And this cost could then be passed onto regular iPhone customers.
Of course, Apple might not pass increased costs onto consumers – so don't panic just yet.
It's also worth remembering that smartphones are increasingly valuable and important to our lives now.
So much of what we do – including talking, getting around and organising our lives – is tied into mobile.
That's why Brits have been willing to cough up progressively more money for their smartphones over the years.
