Trump Says Environmental Regulations Tank The Economy. California Is Proving Him Wrong.
For years, President Trump has insisted that environmental regulations hurt the economy, pledging to roll back Obama-era policies aimed at curbing climate change, bring back the coal industry, and open US coasts to oil drilling.
“I am taking historic steps to lift restrictions on American energy, to reverse government intrusion, and to cancel job-killing regulations,” Trump, flanked by coal miners and coal company executives, said last year at the Environmental Protection Agency.But it turns out there's a place in America that shows the opposite can be true: California, where the economy has grown rapidly despite the state's toughest-in-the-nation policy on greenhouse emissions.This week, the California Air Resources Control Board (CARB) announced the state had reduced its carbon emissions by 13% since 2004, dropping below 1990 levels for the first time, and reaching its target four years early.The news was hailed by environmental groups, regulatory officials, and Gov. Jerry Brown.
