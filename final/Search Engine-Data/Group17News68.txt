Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is coming to Switch this December, and it will support a variety of controller options, including the GameCube controller--the preferred gamepad of many Smash Bros. players. Nintendo confirmed during E3 2018 that Wii U's GameCube Controller Adapter will be compatible with Ultimate, but if you don't have one of those laying around, you'll be able to pick up a new one at launch.
During a hands-on session with Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, a Nintendo representative said that a new GameCube controller adapter will be released alongside the game, and it'll retail for $20. Nintendo also confirmed it will offer a new line of Smash-branded GameCube controllers later this year, although pricing details for those have yet to be announced.
In addition to GameCube controllers, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate will be playable with either a Switch Pro Controller or a single Joy-Con. Nintendo also confirmed the game will be compatible with all existing Super Smash Bros. Amiibo. The two newest additions to the game's roster, Inkling and Ridley, will also receive their own figures, and they can be trained up just as previous Smash Bros. Amiibo.
Super Smash Bros. Ultimate launches for Switch on December 7. It features the largest roster in the series to date, with every character who has ever appeared in a Smash Bros. game returning for this installment--including Snake, who is voiced once again by David Hayter.
