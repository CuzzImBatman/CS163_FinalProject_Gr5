Abandoned mental asylums, ‘village of the dead’ and Chernobyl – the creepiest places you can visit on Google Street View
GOOGLE Maps is useful to get you from A to B but many people don't realise that Google Street View can turn you into an actual explorer.
Take a look at some of the creepiest places in the world that you can wander around from the safety of your own home.
This small village in Japan definitely isn't a good place to get lost if you need to ask for directions.
When someone in the village dies, a lady who lives there, called Tsukimi Ayano, will replace them with a doll version of themselves.
The hundreds of dolls now greatly outnumber the amount of living people in the isolated mountain residence and you can spot lots of them on Google Street View.
The Chernobyl nuclear power plant is situated near the now-abandoned town of Pripyat in Ukraine.
The power plant exploded in April 1986 when its poorly designed fourth reactor suffered a huge power surge.
Around 116 000 people were evacuated from the surrounding area and there is now a 30km exclusion zone where it is illegal to live.
You can visit the area for a short period of time as a tourist or you can be even more cautious and just look at the area on Google Maps and see how the catastrophic accident created a ghost town.
This hut was originally erected in 1911 by the British Antarctic Expedition of 1910–1913, originally led by famous explorer Robert Falcon Scott.
Scott died along with his companions after a fatal mission to the South Pole in 1912.
