 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The major U.S. stock exchanges will be closed on Tuesday, January 2 to mark the death of former President Gerald Ford, leaving stock trading suspended for an unusually long four consecutive days. 

 The New York Stock Exchange will be closed January 2,, the exchange's parent company NYSE Group said Friday, joining the Nasdaq Stock Market, which said Thursday that it would close. The Tuesday closing is unusual because trading was already slated to be shut on Monday, January 1, for New Year's Day and U.S. exchanges tend to avoid being closed for consecutive weekdays -- particularly when they immediately follow or precede weekends, analysts said. "Certainly this is disruptive to trading in the market," said Octavio Marenzi, chief executive of consultant firm Celent Communications, who was surprised by the decision. On Thursday, President Bush declared January 2 a national day of mourning for Ford, who died the day after Christmas. The exchanges have historically closed on a national day of mourning for a U.S. president. After the death of former President Ronald Reagan, the exchanges closed for a national day of mourning on June 11, 2004. According to NYSE records, the Big Board has been shut for two or more consecutive weekdays in only a few instances during the last century, including September 11-14, 2001, following the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon and August 15-16, 1945, at the end of World War II. "It's very rare to close for four days in a row; you get a backlog of orders and stuff," said Leeb Capital Management investment strategist Peter Dunay. "So you may see a little of an increase in orders today just to see people settling a little more because they'll be gone." Joining the two largest U.S. stock markets in closing on January 2 are the International Securities Exchange , Chicago Board Options Exchange, American Stock Exchange, New York Board of Trade and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange said its commodity and equity index markets would close but foreign exchange and interest rate markets would open until 1:00 p.m. EST. The Chicago Board of Trade said it would close its agricultural markets but overnight electronic agricultural markets would trade as normal, opening at 6:30 p.m. CST Monday (0030 GMT Tuesday) and closing at 6 a.m. CST Tuesday. The New York Mercantile Exchange will close its NYMEX and COMEX division trading floors, but electronic trading will remain open. The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) has recommended that the bond market close early, at 2 p.m. EST. The U.S. Treasury moved up the closing times for its already announced offering of 3- and 6-month bills. Treasury said noncompetitive bids would close at 11 a.m. EST on January 2 and competitive bids at 11:30 a.m.
