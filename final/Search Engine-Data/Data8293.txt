Once-rare cloud is now more common, and new study says climate change is to blame
A new study bolsters the theory that human-caused climate change is making it easier to see a rare kind of cloud that is known for brightening up the sky just after sunset or just before sunrise, researchers said.The glimmering noctilucent, or “night-shining,” clouds are the highest clouds in earth’s atmosphere, forming in the middle atmosphere (mesosphere), around 50 miles above earth’s surface.They form when water vapor freezes and forms ice crystals, researchers said.Researchers used computer simulations to model the Northern Hemisphere’s atmosphere and noctilucent clouds from 1871 to 2008, according to the study, which was published last week in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
