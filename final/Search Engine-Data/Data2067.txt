Twelve-year-old super tall basketball star dominates court
Some people were not too supportive, however, pointing out that the boy's extraordinary height advantage was unfair.
A 6ft 10in 12-year-old boy has become a global sensation after video emerged of him towering above his opponents and dominating a basketball match.
The junior basketball player Oliver Rioux, who plays for the Frenchy Phenoms, is able to dunk the ball into the net without even taking his feet off the ground.
The team's strategy seems clear enough - pass it to the tall guy so he can effortlessly put it through the hoop.
The video was posted to Twitter by Basket Cantera TV and Grind City Media, and has had hundreds of thousands of views.
Some people were not too supportive, however, pointing out that his extraordinary height advantage was unfair.
"Omg that isn't even fair. Poor little guys!," one said.
Another added: "That is wrong on so many levels."
Some called for the boy to be put into a higher league, saying he was a "superstar".
