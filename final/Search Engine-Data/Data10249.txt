Multiplayer action game Warframe will be released for Nintendo Switch, developer Digital Extremes has announced. The announcement was made during TennoLive 20189, a yearly event where new details about the game's future are revealed.
A short trailer of the game was also released and it reveals that Panic Button is working on the Switch version. Panic Button has worked on bringing a number of games to Nintendo's latest platform, including Wolfenstein 2 and Doom for Bethesda, and Rocket League for Psyonix.
As of yet, a release date for the Nintendo Switch version of Warframe has not been confirmed. The subject of how the game will approach offline play on Switch has also not been discussed yet.
Warframe is a free-to-play game that's also available on PS4, Xbox One, and PC. The game launched to a mixed reception, with GameSpot awarding it a 6/10. "Some problematic menus pale in comparison to Warframe's real problem: a pervasive tendency toward repetition," said Chris Watters in his Warframe review. "Whether you're forging ahead with a high-level suit or leveling up a new one, Warframe repeats enemies, environments, and scenarios too frequently.
"Without new challenges for your combat abilities, the excitement soon dries up, leaving you without a compelling reason to keep playing. This free-to-play shooter is still technically in beta, so changes may come that make a substantive difference. But as of now, Warframe's interesting combat mechanics are too quickly overcome by the grind of repetition."
Since then, developer Digital Extremes has continued to make tweaks and introduce new content to the game. As a result, Warframe has developed a passionate, dedicated fanbase. On PC, it is frequently one of the most-played games on Steam, alongside DoTA 2, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, and PUBG.
