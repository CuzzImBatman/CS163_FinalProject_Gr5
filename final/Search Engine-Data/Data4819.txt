The most expensive home in Atlanta, a hilltop mansion built by director-actor Tyler Perry, is back on the market and poised to break the $17.5 million price record it set in 2016.

The lavish mansion inspired by France’s Palace of Versailles—and featuring indoor and outdoor pools plus an underground ballroom—hit the market on Thursday for $25 million, making it the most expensive house for sale in Georgia, according to the state’s multiple listing service. Mr. Perry, 48, who operates his eponymous film studios from Atlanta, set a record in 2016 when he sold his behemoth home for $17.5 million to televangelist David Turner, according to property records.

Mr. Perry, known for playing the comedic character Madea, built the opulent, gated estate in 2007 after assembling multiple parcels of land in Atlanta’s affluent neighborhood of Buckhead, according to listing agent Chase Mizell of Atlanta Fine Homes Sotheby's International Realty. Mr. Mizell is co-listing the home with Josh Reeves, also of Sotheby’s.
