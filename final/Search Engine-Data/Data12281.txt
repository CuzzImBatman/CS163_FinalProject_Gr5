Court Rules Megaupload Founder Kim Dotcom Can Be Extradited To U.S.
Notorious internet entrepreneur and founder of Megaupload Kim Dotcom can be extradited to the U.S., a New Zealand court ruled Thursday. Dotcom has been embroiled in a six-year legal saga with the U.S. where he stands accused of multiple racketeering and criminal copyright charges. U.S. authorities say Dotcom and three co-accused Megaupload executives cost film studios and record companies more than $500 million, and generated more than $175 million in revenue for themselves, by encouraging paying users to store and share copyrighted material. Thursday's ruling from the Court of Appeal upholds a ruling from a lower court from 2017, and Dotcom now intends to take his case to the country's highest judicial body—the Supreme Court. “My legal team are confident that the Supreme Court will hear the appeal given there are such significant legal issues at stake,” Dotcom said in a statement.
