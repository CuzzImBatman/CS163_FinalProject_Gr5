Deandre Ayton walked onto the Arizona Wildcats’ charter flight and immediately was greeted by boosters and fans.

“Hey, Deandre, have a good weekend,” a booster said.

Ayton looked at him quizzically.

“I don’t know who you are talking about, this Deandre,” he said with a Spanish lilt. “I’m Alejandro.”

Wait. You didn’t know Alejandro was Ayton’s alter ego? Well, then you should probably meet Josh, too.

“We’ll be sitting on a plane and if things are quiet he’ll start talking in his Josh voice,” said Jeff Dean, Arizona basketball public address announcer. “Josh is a middle-aged yuppie White guy who talks about fun family vacations they went on in the 1980s.”

Deandre Ayton isn’t just the presumptive No. 1 pick in the June 21 draft, the player Phoenix hopes will lead its franchise out of the dark ages. He’s a 19-year-old kid who doesn’t know why everybody has to be so serious all the time.

“He’s just a joyful person,” former UA teammate Rawle Alkins said. “He’s the type of person when he sees a vibe that’s down or sad he’ll try to pick it up.”

To do that, sometimes Josh or Alejandro make an appearance.
“When I was younger I watched Spiderman and they had the Green Goblin and before the Green Goblin died he told Spiderman that it wasn’t him, it was the Green Goblin that was killing all those people,” Ayton said. “I thought, ‘Hmm, I should try to change my personality sometimes when it comes to interviews.’ ”

Ayton then breaks into Alejandro’s voice – Alejandro is from Venezuela, by the way – before seamlessly affecting Josh’s articulate language.

“I wouldn’t say he has split personalities,” Wildcats guard Allonzo Trier said. “But there’s layers to Deandre depending on how well you get to know him.”
