[Separation and identification of differential protein in rat's bone with fluorosis and calcium supplementation intervention].
In order to explore the mechanisms underlying the calcium alleviating fluorosis at protein level, we made an attempt to establish fluorosis and calcium supplementation rat models to isolate and identify bone differential proteins. The bone proteins of different groups were compared by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) and mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), and analyzed by gene ontology annotation, pathway enrichment and interaction networks. The 17 proteins were identified in the fluorosis group (F) and the fluorosis calcium supplement group (F+Ca), including type I collagen (Col1a1), actin (Actb), protein glutamine transferase 2 (Tgm2), compared with the control group (C). These differential proteins are enriched in 38 bone metabolic pathways such as focal adhesion, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, and AMPK signaling pathway. And the functions of these proteins are mainly related to cytoskeleton, energy metabolism, substance transport, ion channel, and apoptosis. Therefore, it is speculated that calcium may alleviate the fluoride-induced bone damage by regulating the focal adhesion, PI3K-Akt, AMPK and other signaling pathway, but the specific mechanism needs further research.
