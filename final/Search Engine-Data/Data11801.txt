Kanye West floats idea of making 52 records in 52 weeks
Kanye West, who earlier this month dropped his own album and produced four others, said Wednesday he may release more music over the course of the year.

New York Times writer Jon Caramanica told the Times’ “Popcast” that West mentioned that he wanted to get a place in Wyoming to make 52 records in 52 weeks, according to Pigeons & Planes.
“He said he wants to get a place in Wyoming and he thinks he wants to spend more time there. He told me at one point he wants to make 52 records in 52 weeks. Take that for what you will,” Caramanica said.

West dropped his own album “Ye” earlier this month. He also produced albums for Pusha T, Kid Cudi, Nas and Teyana Taylor.

West, 41, discussed his support for President Trump in a wide-ranging interview with The New York Times earlier this week.
