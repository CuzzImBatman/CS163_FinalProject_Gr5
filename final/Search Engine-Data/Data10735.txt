A person with knowledge of the situation tells The Associated Press that Nick Nurse has agreed to become the next coach of the Toronto Raptors.

Nurse is replacing Dwane Casey, who was fired after Toronto was swept from the second round of the playoffs by Cleveland. Nurse worked under Casey the past five seasons as an assistant.

According to the person who spoke to the AP, Nurse was in the process of completing contract terms and reaching out to staff Tuesday. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the team had not announced the hiring.

The Raptors went 59-23 this season, the top record in the Eastern Conference and second-best regular-season record in the NBA.

ESPN first reported the hiring.
