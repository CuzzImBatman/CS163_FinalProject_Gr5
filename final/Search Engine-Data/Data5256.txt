Super Smash Bros. Ultimate arrives on Nintendo Switch this December, and while it'll support several different controller options, the only way to play the game for many Smash fans is with a GameCube controller. At E3 2018, Nintendo confirmed existing GameCube controllers will be compatible with the game via an adapter, but if you don't have any or are interested in adding more to your collection, you can now pre-order one.
The Smash-branded GameCube controller is available to pre-order from both GameStop and Amazon. It retails for $30; however, if you purchase it from the former, be advised that it appears orders are limited to only two controllers.
As was the case with Super Smash Bros. for Wii U, the GameCube controllers require an adapter. Those who have the Wii U controller adapter will be able to use that with Switch. Nintendo is also offering a newly rebranded variety for those who may not have one yet. That is likewise available to pre-order now via Amazon and costs $20.
Super Smash Bros. Ultimate launches for Switch on December 7. It features the largest roster in the series to date; every character who has ever appeared in a Smash title is returning for Ultimate, including Young Link, Pichu, and Snake, who is voiced by original voice actor David Hayter.
