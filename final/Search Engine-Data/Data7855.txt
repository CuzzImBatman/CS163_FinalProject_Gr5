Hong Kong protest: Joshua Wong calls for HK leader Carrie Lam to resign
Hong Kong's most prominent student activist Joshua Wong has called for the resignation of leader Carrie Lam, after walking free from prison.
Wong became the face of the 2014 pro-democracy protests which called for the city to pick its own leaders.
People in Hong Kong are again out on the streets, this time against a controversial extradition bill which allows extradition to mainland China.
Organisers say more than two million people rallied against it on Sunday
This despite the bill being suspended by Ms Lam on Saturday.
Critics have said the legislation would expose people in Hong Kong to China's deeply flawed justice system and lead to further erosion of the city's judicial independence.
Much of the public anger as been directed as Ms Lam, who is pro-Beijing, and on Sunday she apologised for proposing the bill.
After diminishing in numbers overnight, large groups of protesters were seen gathering on key roads near the government headquarters again on Monday. Organisers say protests will continue until the bill is scrapped altogether.
Wong, who received two separate prison sentences in 2017 and 2018 for his part in what became known as the Umbrella Movement, walked free on Monday after serving a reduced sentence of one month.
"[Carrie Lam] is no longer qualified to be Hong Kong's leader," Wong told reporters at the prison. "She must take the blame and resign, be held accountable and step down."
He also celebrated his new found freedom and called for the extradition bill to be withdrawn in a tweet on Monday.
