What is the UK porn ban, when does it start and can you unlock the new block?
UK porn viewers will soon have to prove they are aged 18 or older under new laws.
But when does the block kick in, why is the government changing the rules, and can you switch it off?
Porn sites will soon be required to get proof of ID from UK residents before showing any X-rated clips – in order to protect children.
That includes free porn sites like PornHub and YouPorn – which attract nearly two billion visits a month between them worldwide.
They'll join a number of other sites in using the AgeID system, which requires users to verify their age via an official form of ID.
From July this year, when the new system is being launched, randy internet lurkers will be shown a non-pornographic "landing page", according to AgeID spokesman James Clark.
"When a user first visits a site protected by AgeID, a landing page will appear with a prompt for the user to verify their age before they can access the site," he told The Metro.
"Each website will create their own non-pornographic landing page for this purpose."
When someone first clicks on a site, they'll be asked to register with AgeID and verify their age using a Mobile SMS, credit card, passport or driving licence.
Users will then be able to use their AgeID username or password to access all porn sites that use AgeID – though some may use different age verification systems.
Clark said: "It is a one-time verification, with a simple single sign-on for future access. If a user verifies on one AgeID protected site, they will not need to perform this verification again on any other site carrying AgeID."
Sites face fines of up to £250,000 or a blanket block by UK internet service providers if they do not comply with the rules.
Regulators will also be able to block porn websites if they fail to show that they are denying access to under-18s.
