The U.S. Postal Service is Issuing First Moon Landing Forever Stamps 

On July 20, 1969, Apollo 11 astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin walked on the Moon: an achievement that had long been confined to the realm of science fiction. A breathless world watched as Armstrong stepped onto the Moon’s surface and famously said, “That’s one small step for (a) man, one giant leap for mankind.”

To mark the 50th anniversary of this first Moon landing, the U.S. Postal Service will issue two forever stamps to celebrate this historic moment. One stamp features Armstrong’s iconic photograph of Aldrin in his spacesuit on the surface of the Moon. The other stamp, a photograph of the moon taken in 2010 by Gregory H. Revera from his home in Madison, Alabama, shows the landing site of the lunar module, Eagle, in the Sea of Tranquility. The site is indicated on the stamp by a dot. Art director Antonio Alcalá designed the stamp art.

The first day of issue event for the stamps is free and open to the public with paid admission to the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex (KSCVC), on Friday, July 19, 2019, at 11 a.m. EDT at the Apollo Saturn V Center (requiring bus transport from the KSCVC), at Space Commerce Way, Merritt Island, Florida. Later in the day, Kennedy Space Center will also serve as one of several remote locations for a live NASA TV broadcast, as we celebrate the historic accomplishments of the Apollo Mission and anticipate NASA’s return to the Moon in 2024.
