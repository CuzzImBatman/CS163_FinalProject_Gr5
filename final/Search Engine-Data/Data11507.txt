 LONDON  (Reuters) - Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS.L ) and its partners have made an indicative offer worth $24.5 billion for ABN AMRO's U.S. bank arm LaSalle, conditional on them also buying the rest of ABN, sources familiar with the matter said. 

 The group will also propose an offer of about 39 euros per share, including a 60 euro cent dividend, for all of ABN, the sources told Reuters, which would value the Dutch bank at about 72 billion euros. That would trump an offer for ABN from Barclays ( BARC.L ), but the consortium's offer is conditional on a number of issues, including the LaSalle deal and it not being exposed to any litigation related to LaSalle, the sources said.
