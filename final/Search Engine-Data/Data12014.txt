It's a good time to be a PC gamer, because you can almost always find a sale going on somewhere. Right now on the Humble Store, Square Enix has dropped prices on its games by up to 85%. That means you can get great deals on series like Final Fantasy, Tomb Raider, Just Cause, and more. There's no end date listed, so grab any games you want before they go back to normal price. Now let's get into the specifics.
Final Fantasy fans can get just about every game in the series for half off right now. That brings Final Fantasy 3-6 down to $8 each, 7 and 8 are $6 each, and 9 and the remastered version of 10 and its sequel are $15. Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age is down to $25, while the chibi-filled World of Final Fantasy gets chopped to $20.
The whole Tomb Raider series is on sale, going all the way back to the games from the '90s. Early installments, including the original game, are just $2. If you want to get caught up on the recent installments before the next one arrives this fall, you can scoop up Tomb Raider for $5 and Rise of the Tomb Raider: 20 Year Celebration for $20.
Other series, like Just Cause and Life is Strange, are on also sale, as are many of Square Enix's one-offs like Murdered: Soul Suspect and the throwback RPGs I Am Setsuna and Lost Sphear. You can find the full list of the publisher's deals here.
While you're at the Humble Store, you can also assemble your very own bundle of Telltale games for a sizable discount. You can pick between three and five games to get between 75% and 80% off. Assemble your adventure game bundle here.
