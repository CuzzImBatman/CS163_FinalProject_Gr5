Dow slips for eighth day in a row on growing fears over U.S.-China trade dispute
Car makers and technology and industrial companies fell Thursday as investors focused on the U.S.-China trade dispute, which could reduce company spending and earnings. The Dow Jones industrial average slipped for the eighth day in a row.

Although investors generally don't expect a trade war between the U.S. and China, they remain sensitive to signs that rising tariffs and trade tensions will hurt the global economy and reduce corporate profits. This week they've received some signs that this is happening.

Kate Moore, global equity strategist for BlackRock, said that investors have been hoping that the Republican-backed corporate tax cut would encourage companies to hire more workers, boost pay and expand their operations, but the uncertainty over tariffs is discouraging them from doing that.

“There's a fear that rising uncertainty around trade and tariffs is going to significantly affect investment decisions and hiring decisions, and potentially take some steam off of what has looked like a very strong expansion,” she said.

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Wednesday that the Fed has heard about businesses holding off on hiring and spending in response to the trade conflicts.

In other big news, online retailers skidded and rivals such as department stores rose after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that states can force more online shoppers to pay sales tax.

For more than two decades, companies were not required to collect sales tax on online purchases that were made in a state where the company did not have a physical presence, such as a warehouse or office. States argued that those rules deprived them of billions of dollars in tax revenue, and traditional retailers said online sellers had an unfair advantage.
