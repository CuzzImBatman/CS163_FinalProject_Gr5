INDING CLOTILDA

Lost since its fateful voyage in 1860, Clotilda—the last slave ship to bring African captives to the American South—has been discovered in the Mobile-Tensaw Delta of Alabama. Archaeologists combed through hundreds of original sources for clues to find the historic vessel and confirm its identity. Here are some key pieces of evidence.
DIMENSIONS

Insurance documents provided detailed descriptions of the schooner, including its construction and dimensions. The sunken vessel matches Clotilda’s measurements and materials, including its southern yellow pine planks and white oak frames.
THE HOLD

Clotilda’s cramped hold, only seven feet high, was originally designed

to transport cargo, not people. Planks were laid down at the bottom of the hull, where 110 people endured the six-week voyage.
COPPER SHEATHING

The hull was sheathed in copper to protect it from decay and ocean waves. Only five schooners built in the Mobile area at the time were insured for transatlantic sailing, which required this protective copper sheathing.
GALVANIZED FASTENERS

Iron fasteners in the hull would corrode if they came in

contact with the copper sheathing. Clotilda’s fasteners

were galvanized in hot-dipped zinc, then countersunk

and plugged with wood and pitch.
CLOTILDA’S JOURNEY

In 1860, Clotilda smuggled West African captives into the U.S.

Routes and dates are taken from the account of the ship’s captain, William Foster
CLOTILDA’S FINAL RESTING PLACE

According to Captain Foster, after the voyage he burned Clotilda to the waterline and sank the ship in about 20 feet of water in the Mobile River. Later attempts to hide her location included using dynamite to blast the wreck. Archaeologists have found the wreck buried in silt using 3D scanners, magnetometers, and other technology.
