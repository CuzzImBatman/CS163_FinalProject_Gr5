Duran Duran's Simon Le Bon denies sexual assault claim
Simon Le Bon has denied claims he sexually assaulted a woman during a record signing in Los Angeles 23 years ago.
The 59-year-old Duran Duran front man said allegations that he inappropriately touched Shereen Hariri were "completely untrue".
In a statement, posted on Duran Duran's official Facebook page but since deleted, Ms Hariri accused Le Bon of grabbing her "butt cheek" before "making his way down my butt to my genitals".
Ms Hariri alleges the incident occurred at the record shop where she worked at the time - The Warehouse - while she was assisting Le Bon at the signing table and he was posing for photos.
She said she was left "shocked and completely frozen" and was "afraid of the consequences" of saying anything at the time.
She called the alleged attack "smug, so self-assured, so unbelievably brazen".
She wrote: "If I made a scene, I'd be in the press: The 'Girl Who Accused Simon Le Bon'. I'd probably be fired, rejected, ignored, even hated."
She said she told her then-boyfriend, at least one supervisor and several co-workers what had happened at the time.
Ms Hariri, who was 24 when the alleged assault took place, now works as a therapist in Los Angeles, and says she wants "everyone to know what this man did to me".
Referring to Le Bon's wife Yasmin and his three daughters in her statement, she alluded to Donald Trump, writing: "I hope none of them are grabbed by the pussy by a powerful man just because he can."
