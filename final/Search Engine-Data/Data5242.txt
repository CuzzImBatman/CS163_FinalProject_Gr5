Super Smash Bros. Ultimate will launch December 7 for Nintendo Switch, Nintendo announced during its E3 2018 briefing. It's one of Nintendo's biggest franchises, and the launch in December right before the holidays will surely help Switch console sales improve further still.
As announced during Nintendo's E3 briefing, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate will include every previously released character, as well as new ones like Inkling Girl and Boy and Ridley. Additionally, you can use a GameCube controller, which is pretty great, although you will need the appropriate adapter to connect it to the system.
Also new for the sequel is that you choose a stage before selecting a character. This way, you can cater your choice of character to the level you'll be playing on, which will come as welcome news to more competitive players.
Nintendo's presentation focused heavily on Ultimate, dedicating a large chunk of the broadcast to outlining the game and its many, many characters. Although it had been previously announced, this was out first real look at the game--prior to this, we didn't know if it was an even a new game or some kind of remaster. Now we know it's a wholly original game that boasts an absolutely massive roster.
