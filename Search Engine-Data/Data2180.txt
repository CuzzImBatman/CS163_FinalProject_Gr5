The only shock is that there’s no shock. The new Miley Cyrus single, written by Ms. Cyrus herself, 
is as nice as can be: It’s a love song that savors a “brand new start” and the comforts of being 
“Next to you/in Malibu.” Folk-rock electric guitar chords are soon joined by a hefty kick drum; 
she sings about past insecurities, current contentment and “Hoping I just stay the same, and 
nothing will change/And it’ll be us, just for a while.” The video clip has her happily roaming 
the beach in white outfits, a perfectly art-directed woman in love. JON PARELES
