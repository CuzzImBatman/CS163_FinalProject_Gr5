LaMelo Ball’s departure from Lithuania’s BC Vytautas to LaVar Ball’s Junior Basketball Association was a predictable result to an erratic stint in Europe.

Yet, the youngest Ball brother’s move to the startup basketball league evidently wasn’t LaVar’s idea at first. It was something LaMelo had to pitch to his father as his experience in Europe grew more frustrating.

The latest episode of Ball in the Family detailed the decision-making process that led to LaMelo being anointed “the face” of the JBA. At first, LaVar was reluctant with the idea, thinking that LaMelo wouldn’t benefit by playing against JBA competition. The league did not attract any top-150 recruits.

LaMelo said of the JBA, “More of my style. Plus, I want to play for the hometown L.A.”

LaVar ultimately decided to give LaMelo the green light for the JBA after making trips to the U.S. for tryouts. He realized that the league needed a known star to market around, and LaMelo would be just that. LaVar would also take over his son’s basketball development.

“I’m looking for someone to develop Melo,” LaVar said. “I’m that guy.”

With the JBA opener three days away, ticket sales continue to struggle.
