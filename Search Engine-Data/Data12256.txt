WHEN YOU WERE A KID, YOU PASSED SIX-FOOT PRETTY EARLY ON. WAS BUYING CLOTHES DIFFICULT?
It was a struggle. When we found something that fit, we’d buy a bunch of them. Jeans fit? We’d buy four pairs. We always went to JC Penney. That’s why I have a partnership with them. I always shopped there, my mom shops there.

WHEN YOU FINISHED UP AT LSU IN 1992, YOU KNEW ALL EYES WERE GOING TO BE ON YOU ON DRAFT NIGHT, SO GETTING A GOOD SUIT WAS IMPORTANT. WHAT WAS THE DRAFT DAY SUIT EXPERIENCE?
I was in Los Angeles at the time, and I heard from a tailor who wanted to make me a custom suit while I was filming Blue Chips.

DO YOU HAVE ADVICE FOR THE YOUNG GUYS GOING THROUGH THE DRAFT NOW? WHAT SHOULD THEY BE THINKING ABOUT WHEN THEY PICK THEIR SUITS?
Fashion is about showing who you are. For me, I like the straight leg suits with nice shoes, loud ties. And I want to look good. I want the checked jackets and all that.

NOW YOU CAN AFFORD CUSTOM SUITS, BUT WHAT ADVICE DO YOU HAVE FOR THE BIG GUYS WHO CAN’T?
Try the stuff you think is for the little guys. I always saw the little guys who walked around in their little Italian suits. Now we can have those. The little guys? Their time is over. It’s time for the big guys.

WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU GIVE TO LEBRON JAMES AT THIS POINT IN HIS CAREER?
The thing with LeBron is that at this point, his legacy is set. I get why he wants to set his legacy, but it’s set with three rings. He doesn’t need to run around chasing rings.

It’s all about getting my son ready for college. He’s starting at UCLA in the fall so it’s about him.
