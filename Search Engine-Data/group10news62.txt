North Korean officials snub meeting on US soldiers' remains
North Korean officials did not attend a planned meeting with Americans to discuss the return of US soldiers' remains, officials have said.
Kim Jong Un had committed to returning the remains of the troops from the 1950-53 conflict during talks with US President Donald Trump on 12 June.
US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo did not acknowledge a question about the no-show when reporters asked him in Brussels on Thursday.
While visiting Pyongyang last week, Mr Pompeo said that a Pentagon team would meet with the North's officials in or around Panmunjon - the truce village on the border between North and South Korea.
A US official waited at the border of the village but no North Korean official showed up, according to South Korea's Yonhap news agency.
"The US wanted to have talks as early as 12 July but the North did not seem to be ready," an unnamed Seoul official said.
"Both the US and the North are still in discussion over when to meet," the official added.
North Korea has offered to rearrange the meeting over war remains for Sunday instead, US State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said.
"Midday today they contacted us and offered to meet on Sunday. We will be ready," she said in a statement.
