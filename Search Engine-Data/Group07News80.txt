This Week in NASA History: 1st Full-Thrust, Long-Duration F-1 Engine Test -- May 26, 1962



This week in 1962, the first full-thrust, long-duration F-1 engine test was successfully conducted. The F-1 engine was developed by Rocketdyne under the direction of NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center and was propelled by a mixture of RP-1, a type of kerosene, and liquid oxygen. The engine was used in a cluster of five engines to propel the Saturn V rocket’s first stage, the S-IC stage. Each engine produced 1.5 million pounds of thrust. Here, the F-1 engine is test-fired at Test Stand 1-C at Edwards Air Force Base in California. Now through December 2022, NASA will mark the 50th anniversary of the Apollo Program that landed a dozen astronauts on the Moon between July 1969 and December 1972, and the first U.S. crewed mission -- Apollo 8 -- that circumnavigated the Moon in December 1968. The NASA History Program is responsible for generating, disseminating and preserving NASA’s remarkable history and providing a comprehensive understanding of the institutional, cultural, social, political, economic, technological and scientific aspects of NASA’s activities in aeronautics and space.
