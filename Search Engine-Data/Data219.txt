The OnePlus 7 Pro is the firms largest, most expensive and most premium phone yet. While not that cheap, it still undercuts the competition by some margin, while offering sheer speed and a stunning notchless display that even its most expensive rivals cant touch.
Starting at 649, the OnePlus 7 Pro is 150 more expensive than last years 6T or its 2019 refresh the 7 (non-Pro). Its also significantly bigger.
The 6.67in QHD+ AMOLED screen is absolutely massive and runs at a refresh rate of 90Hz, meaning the screen updates 90 times per second  which is 50% faster than most phones and a first for an OLED screen. The difference is immediately noticeable, even simply scrolling in apps, web pages and between home screens. You quickly get used to it, of course, until you try to go back to a 60Hz phone.
The screen is also a seamless slate, with no cut-outs for sensors and selfie cameras. Instead the selfie camera is mounted in a motorised module that pops up from the top of the phone. With curved edges and tiny bezels all round, the OnePlus 7 Pro feels like the end of the road for traditional smartphone design. Theres nothing left on the front but screen.
The rest of the phone is fairly par for the course. Theres a USB-C port in the bottom, a triple camera lump on the back and no headphone socket. The curved glass front meets metal and more curved glass on the back. Its a simple, attractive look, very reminiscent of Samsungs phones for the last few years.
Despite the minimal bezels, theres no getting over how big the OnePlus 7 Pro is: 206g in weight, 162.6mm tall, 75.9mm wide and 8.8mm thick. Huaweis 6.47in P30 Pro is noticeably narrower at 73.4mm, while the 6.4in Samsung Galaxy S10+ is 74.1mm wide. Both phones are significantly lighter, too, weighing 192g and 175g respectively.
Only Apples iPhone XS Max, which is one of the hardest big phones to wield, is wider at 77.4mm and heavier at 208g.
All of that is to say the OnePlus 7 Pro is a stretch to use, right on the limit of what I can hold in one hand and not drop while clinging on to public transport, aided by the curved back and hard metal edge.

The OnePlus 7 Pro is the ultimate enthusiast-pleaser on paper, with its specifications reading like a fanboy wish list. It has Qualcomms latest top Snapdragon 855 processor with your choice of 6GB, 8GB or 12GB of RAM; 6GB is good, 8GB is ideal for 2019, and 12GB is total overkill.
But the OnePlus 7 Pro is also the first to use the new, significantly faster UFS 3.0 standard for its 128GB or 256GB of storage instead of the common UFS2.1. The only other phone to use UFS
