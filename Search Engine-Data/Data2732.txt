Have you wanted to play as, what the official WWE Twitter account calls, the "#BaddestWomanOnThePlanet" in a WWE game? Do you like to get rowdy in the wrestling ring? Ever wondered how the former UFC Women's Bantamweight Champion would hold her own against your created wrestler? You can answer all these questions and more, as 2K Sports has announced that Ronda Rousey will make her WWE console video game debut in WWE 2K19 as a pre-order bonus.
"As a WWE Superstar, having support from the Piper family means everything to me," said Ronda Rousey. "Itâ€™s an honor to be part of WWE 2K19 and have my name mentioned alongside so many important Superstars in WWE history, including Rey Mysterio, Kurt Angle, Ultimate Warrior, Sting, and Goldberg."
In addition to Ronda Rousey, you get the masked wrestler Rey Mysterio if you buy early. Both wrestlers will come with signature outfits: Rey Mysterio's "Royal Rumble 2018" outfit and Ronda Rousey's "WrestleMania 34/Roddy Piper-inspired" outfit. Those that purchase either the Deluxe or Collector's Editions of WWE 2K19 will receive early access to the game and the game's season pass.

The Deluxe and Collector's Editions of WWE 2K19 will be available on October 5, while the Standard Edition of WWE 2K19 will be available on October 9. No Nintendo Switch release has been announced, but WWE 2K18 did come to the system after it launched on other platforms.
