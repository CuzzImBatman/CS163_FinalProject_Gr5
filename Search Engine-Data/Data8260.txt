Oh, Chuck.

Charles Barkley and the stars of Inside the NBA were a team on a recent episode of Celebrity Family Feud, and the Hall of Famer was asked “If a man’s zipper breaks at church, what might he use to cover it up?”

Barkley’s answer: “A child.”
Whaaatt?

That answer sent teammate Ernie Johnson across the stage to join the opposing squad. Barkley tried to clarify: “I meant a baby.”

Here’s the best thing about this moment: THAT WAS TECHNICALLY ON THE BOARD!

“Person” was an answer. Unbelievable.

Here are Barkley and Shaquille O’Neal playing Fast Money, and the pair absolutely killed it.
