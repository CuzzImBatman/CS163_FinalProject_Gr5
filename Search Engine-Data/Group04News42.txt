Complementary and alternative therapy for pediatric acne: A review of botanical extracts, dietary interventions, and oral supplements.
Abstract
Many supplements and products containing botanical extracts are marketed to patients for the treatment of acne vulgaris. Additionally, increasing attention has been paid to the role of diet in acne vulgaris. Studies on this topic including pediatric patients are limited, with variable efficacy data. Despite these limitations, knowledge of alternative therapies in pediatric acne vulgaris is often expected from pediatric dermatologists. Here we review available data on the efficacy of complementary and alternative medicines for treatment of acne in pediatric patients, focusing on topical, oral, and dietary modifications.
