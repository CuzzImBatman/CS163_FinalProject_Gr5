Digital Strategy

Making Machine-Readable the Norm

On May 9, 2013, President Obama signed an executive order that made open and machine-readable data the new default for government information. Making information about government operations more readily available and useful is also core to the promise of a more efficient and transparent government.

NASA is committed to making our data, software, and tools available to the public to spur innovation and improve the lives of citizens of this planet. To achieve these ends, the NASA Digital Strategy Report is outlined here.

In responding to Milestone 4.2 of the Digital Government Strategy, NASA heeded the Advisory Group's encouragement to "build upon existing structures and processes as much as possible." To locate the gaps in existing governance structures, NASA's Digital Strategy response team identified all necessary decisions concerning digital services, using the three layers pointed out in the Digital Strategy--information, platform, presentation--as a guide. Our digital services governance framework is described in more detail here.
