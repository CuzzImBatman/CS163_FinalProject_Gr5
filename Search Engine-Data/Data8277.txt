Bea Johnson reveals how she lives a plastic-free life
EVEN before she started the zero-waste movement Bea Johnson was firmly against plastic.“I switched to glass way before I started the zero-waste lifestyle,” Ms Johnson told news.com.au.She has since developed a system for living without creating rubbish, which rejects disposable items in favour of reusable ones.While plastic can be reusable, Ms Johnson said she chose to live plastic-free.“Personally I’ve read books on plastic’s impact on the environment and on its impact on people’s health,” she said. “Once I did that there was no way I would continue using those items.”In particular, Ms Johnson pointed to the presence of BPA (Bisphenol A), a chemical used in the lining of food and drink packaging, including the lining of canned foods, to extend their shelf life.BPA is an endocrine disrupter that has been linked to breast and prostate cancers, genital defects in males, early onset of puberty in females, obesity and behavioural problems such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.“It’s having a really crazy impact on our society and if you are not aware of this, it’s understandable if you want to continue using it,” Ms Johnson said. “But once you are aware, there’s no way you would continue using them.”Ms Johnson acknowledged that some people found plastic containers lighter and easier to carry“Some zero wasters like to use them because they are lighter to carry, that’s their choice,” she said. “It’s up to everyone to live how they wish, I just provide the alternatives that we’ve discovered.”Ms Johnson is also not a fan of landfill biodegradable items and points to the findings of archaeologist William L Rathje, who discovered a tub of guacamole that survived pretty much intact, for more than 20 years at the tip.“He showed that for something to biodegrade there needs to be air and light but in a landfill none of this happens,” Ms Johnson said. “Bags sold as biodegradable, that’s greenwashing. It’s not something that actually happens.”Instead Ms Johnson chooses to live plastic and waste free by following a system she developed called the five R’s: Refuse, reduce, reuse, recycle and rot.
