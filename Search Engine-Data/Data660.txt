YouTubes haphazard response to an anti-gay harassment controversy this week underscores the companys continuing failure to protect creators from hate speech, queer users say.
The platforms initial refusal to discipline Steven Crowder for years of sustained anti-gay and racist harassment of Carlos Maza, a video journalist for the US news site Vox, drew widespread criticism.
The companys response was not surprising, said Ash Hardell, a queer and non-binary YouTuber who said they had received little support from the company despite years of harassment. Watching YouTube send a series of conflicting messages regarding abuse from its official Twitter account, which is sporting a rainbow-emblazoned logo for Pride month, only added to the frustration.
It feels like a slap in the face when they use queer content in their promotional videos, they said. It feels like exploitation  if you want to use us, you actually have to care about us.
Hardell posts LGBTQ educational and entertainment content, with videos like I Dyed My Armpits Rainbow ... cause Gay and Hilarious Prank on my Wife. They have intimately documented their coming out process and top surgery procedure, sharing confessional videos with hundreds of thousands of followers. 
They have also had content censored and comments disabled due to problems with YouTubes algorithm. In 2018, also during Pride month, YouTube was criticized after anti-LGBTQ ads were run alongside content made by queer creators.
This weeks controversy began when Maza made a video outlining the years of abuse he has endured from the rightwing video personality Steven Crowder. YouTube said Crowders attacks on Maza calling him a gay Mexican, a lispy queer and a token Vox gay atheist sprite did not violate its community guidelines against harassment.
After criticism, YouTube announced it would be re-evaluating harassment policies and update them in coming months. Google employees under the group moniker Googlers Against Hate called on the company, which is owned by Google, to remove its rainbow branding until it changed its policies.
Kat Blaque, a YouTuber and trans rights activist, said YouTubes revenue model inherently incentivized volatile behavior. Blaque has made videos about why liberals annoy me, defining anarchy, and topics related to dating, weight loss, and beauty.
When YouTube allowed monetization for all creators, it empowered a group of people to create content, not because they were passionate about it, but because it made them a lot of money, Blaque said. With that, you have people who inevitably find out that being mean to other people is lucrative.
Demonetizing hateful content is a step in the right direction, but the companys refusal to remove Crowders account suggests he is the kind of creator YouTube wants, Blaque said.
YouTubes unclear terms of service make addressing harassment confusing and difficult, Hardell said, noting that the company appeared to have made them intentionally vague. As of now, YouTube bans abusive videos and comments on the site but doesnt clarify what constitutes abuse.
If harassment crosses the line into a malicious attack it can be reported and may be removed, the guidelines say. In other cases, users may be mildly annoying or petty and should be ignored.
Hardell said because of this wording, it was difficult to tell if Crowders videos violated YouTubes harassment policy. Indeed, YouTube itself seems to be unclear
