Tribal casino may be coming to Tri-Cities
KENNEWICK, Wash. (AP) — The Colville Tribes have bought land just outside Pasco, Washington, that could be used for a casino and other economic development projects.

The Tri-City Herald reports the 184 acres purchased are in Franklin County just north of Pasco.

Rodney Cawston, chairman of the Colville Business Council, says the tribes’ planned economic development is intended to provide employment for Colville members and members of other tribes in the area, as well as for the surrounding communities in general.


Several hundred Colville confederated tribal members live in the Tri-Cities-area.

No firm plans have been made but Initial development might be a convenience store and gas station, with a possible casino several years away.

The Colville Tribes now have casinos in Omak, Coulee Dam and Manson.
