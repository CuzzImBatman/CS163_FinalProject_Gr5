Jordan Lindsay, from Torrance, California, was snorkelling with her family when she was attacked in the Bahamas.

A "beautiful and gentle" 21-year-old woman has been killed by three sharks while on holiday in the Bahamas.

Jordan Lindsay, from Torrance, California, was snorkelling with her family, including her parents, when she was attacked near Rose Island, northeast of Nassau.

Relatives reportedly spotted the sharks and tried to warn her by yelling at her, but she did not hear them in time.

She was bitten by the predators in the arms, legs, and bottom. Her right arm was severed.

Ms Lindsay was taken to hospital but later pronounced dead.

A post-mortem examination is expected to take place in Nassau following the attack on Tuesday afternoon.

Her father Michael Lindsey told ABC News: "Jordan was 21 and such a great daughter and person. We already miss her terribly."

Her younger sister, Madison Lindsey, has started a GoFundMe page to help the family with funeral costs and bringing her body back home.

The page said: "Jordan Lindsey was a beloved daughter, sister, girlfriend, and friend.

"On June 26, 2019 Jordan was tragically killed from a shark attack in the Bahamas.

"Jordan had the most beautiful, gentle soul and she will be missed deeply."

Officials with the Bahamas government expressed their "condolences and deepest sympathies" to the victim's family.
