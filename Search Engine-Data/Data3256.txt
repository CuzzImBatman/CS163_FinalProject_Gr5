It appears as though New York Knicks big man Enes Kanter has moved on from trolling LeBron James to legitimately trying to recruit him.

With all eyes around the league focused on James with less than two weeks before the start of free agency, Kanter says he's "trying" to lure the Cleveland Cavaliers star to the Big Apple.

“I don’t want to say it’s possible, whatever, but I’m trying," Kanter told The Athletic over the weekend. "Let’s give him a shot. Why not? Might just get him. Never know.”

James' plans remain a mystery, but the lowly Knicks aren't likely at the top of his list. Still, the allure of one of the NBA's cornerstone franchises combined with the presence of head coach David Fizdale, who coached James in Miami, is enough to keep the Knicks relevant in this conversation.

“I’m working, man," Kanter continued. "I need some help. I’m working on it. I think just because it’s New York. If he wins here he is the G.O.A.T. No question, he is the G.O.A.T. I think we have a good chance to get him, I guess.”
Kanter, like James, can opt out of his contract and become a free agent this summer, but says he has no problem taking less money if it helps the Knicks land James.

“Yes, I know this but if LeBron said ‘OK, I’m coming to New York,’ I’ll take a pay cut,” Kanter said. “This is big news.”
