Ed Sheeran wins council battle to keep pub sign dedicated to his wife
It is the latest victory for the singer, who has found himself in hot water several times over plans for his sprawling estate.
Ed Sheeran has won a fight to keep a pub sign he put up without permission at his country estate in Suffolk, dedicated to his wife.

The singer-songwriter, worth an estimated £160m, was told to take down the 16ft (4m) plaque, which reads The Lancaster Lock - after Cherry Lancaster Seaborn.
The Thinking Out Loud singer is also allowed to keep a smaller, swinging style pub sign outside his Grade II-listed barn, which is said to be joined to his mansion by an underground tunnel.

In a U-turn, East Suffolk Council said the signage "is not illuminated and it would not impact on the amenity of the neighbouring properties".

A council spokesperson told Sky News: "The Listed Building Consent to retain both the fascia sign and hanging sign was permitted through the Councils Scheme of Delegation on the 17 June.

"No objections were received and it was decided that the signs would not cause harm to the character and appearance of the curtilage listed building nor the setting of the adjacent listed building.
"Neither are the signs considered to harm the amenity of the neighbouring properties."
It is the latest victory for the global superstar, who has found himself in hot water several times over development plans for his sprawling estate, reportedly dubbed by some locals as "Sheeranville."
In March, his wildlife pond was given the all-clear by inspectors, despite neighbours complaining the kidney-shaped structure was actually a swimming pool and feared it would be used for a "wild lifestyle."
Sheeran has just announced details of his latest album - called No.6 Collaborations Project - which will be released on 12 July.
