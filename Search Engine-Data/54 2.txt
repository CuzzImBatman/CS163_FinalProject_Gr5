Samsung Galaxy S10+ review: a simply stunning screen
A fantastic display bolted to great cameras, a strong battery, an ultrasonic fingerprint scanner and even a headphone socket

The Galaxy S10+ may be Samsungs most important phone in years, but at 899 does the huge screen, triple camera and fancy ultrasonic fingerprint scanner make for a worthy upgrade?
One thing is obvious: the Galaxy S10+ is not the future of smartphones. That would be the Galaxy Fold and Huawei Mate X, devices with folding screens that cost 2,000-plus. Instead the the Galaxy S10+ is one of the finest examples of todays smartphones. Iterative but excellent. And you wont need a mortgage to buy it.
Everything starts with the screen, and oh what a screen it is. At 6.4in its a monster, pushed all the way to the top and bottom, and curve at the sides with a hole in the screen in the top right corner through which the dual selfie-cameras poke.
Honors View20 had this hole-punch notch design first, but Samsungs made it its own with a screen that is easily the best ever on any device. Nothing comes close to the sheer beauty of it, with rich colours, inky blacks, competition-crushing brightness and an image quality that has me seriously considering having to upgrade my TV. Out of the box its set to full HD+ resolution for power-saving reasons, but it is a QHD+ screen. I never felt the need to increase the resolution, unlike last years S9+, but its there if you want it, or have 4K movies to watch on it.
Despite the gigantic screen, the curved glass, lack of bezels and 175g weight make the Galaxy S10+ just under the limit of what I can comfortably hold. For comparison, the S10+ is 1.8mm wider than the Huawei Mate 20 Pro and 3.3mm narrower than Apples iPhone XS Max, but is significantly lighter by 14g and a full 33g respectively. Weight can determine how difficult it is to hold something of that size.
Its not all good news, however. The curved screen pushed right to the edges meant I registered unwanted touches from my palm in the bottom right corner, which sometimes resulted in my zooming in Chrome rather than scrolling. An occasional annoyance rather than a deal killer, but not something that affected either the Mate 20 Pro nor Galaxy S9+.
The rest of the device is very well made. A polished aluminium frame and curved glass back with a small central triple camera lump means the phone doesnt rock when you type on it flat on a desk.
The bottom of the phone has the USB-C port and, surprisingly for 2019, a normal, 3.5mm headphone socket. The Galaxy S10+ has the now expected IP68 water resistance rating, making it good up to a depth of 1.5m for up to 30 minutes, or more likely, a trip down the loo.
