The Galaxy S10e is Samsungs attempt to offer a flagship smartphone experience in a smaller body and at a lower cost, which mostly works.
The formula is simple: take the same processor, reduce the memory a little and squeeze it into a smaller, less complicated body.
The AMOLED screen is only 5.8in on the diagonal, only FHD+ and only flat, not curved at the edges. Whether any of those are downsides depends on your view of curved screens. The display isnt visibly worse than the S10, and it still has the hole-punch notch through which the selfie camera pokes.
The display is covered in last years Corning Gorilla Glass 5, not 6 as fitted to the regular S10, so it might be a little less scratch resistant or prone to smashing on impact.
With rounded metal sides and glass front and back, it looks fairly simple in design terms. Get it in prism white or canary yellow and itll stand out from the crowd. The S10e is easy to hold onto at only 69.9mm wide and 142.2mm tall, which makes it one of the smallest flagship phones on the market alongside Googles Pixel 3.
In reality it doesnt feel all that smaller than the S10 because its only 0.5mm narrower and 7g lighter.
Theres the lesser-spotted headphone socket in the bottom, next to the USB-C port, and the phone is water resistant to IP68 standards: 1.5m depths of up to 30 minutes.
Screen: 5.8in FHD+ AMOLED (438ppi)
Processor: Samsung Exynos 9820 or Qualcomm Snapdragon 855
RAM: 6GB of RAM
Storage: 128GB
Operating system: One UI based on Android 9 Pie
Camera: rear dual camera, front 10MP selfie-camera
Connectivity: dual sim, LTE, wifi, NFC, Bluetooth 5, wireless charging and GPS
Dimensions: 142.2 x 69.9 x 7.9mm

The Galaxy S10e has the same processor  the Samsung Exynos 9820 in the EU or the Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 in the US  as the larger, more expensive Galaxy S10 and S10+.
The cheaper phone has only 6GB of memory compared with 8GB, but most will likely not notice, as performance was pretty much the same. Only on occasion would an app have to reload when brought back from the recently used apps list.
That means the S10e is as fast and fluid as most of the competition, even if it doesnt quite manage OnePlus 7 Pro-levels of speed.
Battery life on the S10e was a disappointing 25 hours between charges, the same as the regular S10. With the always-on display (AOD) setting off, the phone would last from 7am on day one until 9am on day two, which might be enough to get you into work.
That was while browsing and using apps for five hours with plenty of push messages and emails, watching 60 minutes of offline video, shooting about five photos a day and listening to about five hours of Spotify using Bluetooth headphones.
You will likely have to charge it before a night out so itll get you home the other side. Charging is pretty slow too, taking 95 minutes to fully charge via cable and similar via 15W wireless charging. Wireless powershare works well, but is fairly slow  fine for charging a set of headphones.
