The Trump administration's "zero tolerance" immigration policy that has separated nearly 2,000 migrant children from their parents is drawing some big-name critics.

Announced in April, the White House policy sees adult migrants prosecuted in criminal court rather than civil court, as was the case in the past. This caused a ripple of legal ramifications including the separating of families because children cannot be held in criminal detention.  .   

Chrissy Teigen and her husband John Legend may have made the biggest splash calling for an end of the policy with a $288,000 contribution to the American Civil Liberties Union on President Trump's 72nd birthday on June 14 (which their supporters helped increase to $1 million), but they are far from alone in their criticism. 

Country-music icon and activist Willie Nelson, who grew up in Abbott, Texas (a five-hour drive from the Mexican border), told Rolling Stone: 

"What's going on at our southern border is outrageous. Christians everywhere should be up in arms. What happened to 'Bring us your tired and weak and we will make them strong?' This is still the promise land.”

On Monday, he tweeted from his wife's account, inviting President Trump (and congressional leaders from both parties) to visit a border detention center with him "to better understand what's happening down there."

Ellen DeGeneres urged followers to put aside their political differences: "I don’t care what your politics are, we can’t be a country that separates children from their parents. Do something about this, here."

In a series of tweets, actor and comedian Kumail Nanjiani compared the policy to the Nazi regime. "There are going to be people, many people, who will be able to justify separating children from their families. They'll say the words they need to say to justify it. Forget those people. Those people are hopeless. We have to rally and motivate everyone else. Appeal to humanity."

"We cannot be the good Germans," Nanjiani concluded.

I don’t know what to do. Evil is being done right now and we are afraid to get too loud. This moment in time will define us for generations. 

And people will say I am being dramatic. And I say: you are part of the problem.

 The biggest defense they have is that what they are doing is so horrific that you look like a fool talking about it. It’s beyond the pale. It’s easy to dismiss because how could it really be this bad? 

It is. It’s that bad. We cannot be the good Germans.

Posting a cartoon painting of Attorney General Jeff Sessions in front of a chain link cage, Jim Carrey reworked the famous Statue of Liberty poem: “Give us your huddled masses yearning to breathe free...and we will lock their children in cages with tin-foil blankets. And scar them for life! You know: The American Dream!”

Rapper Common quoted author James Baldwin, whose work was recently adapted into the Academy Award nominated film "I Am Not Your Negro": "“I’m terrified at the moral apathy, the death of the heart which is happening in my country. These people have deluded themselves so long that they really don't think I'm human. And this means that they have become, in themselves, moral monsters” James Baldwin"
