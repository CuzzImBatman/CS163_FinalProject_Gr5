Mexico football fans are believed to have caused a minor earthquake as they celebrated their team's shock win over Germany at the World Cup.
Tremors were recorded in Mexico City after Hirving Lozano fired the winning goal past German goalkeeper Manuel Neuer in Russia, according to seismic monitoring agency Simmsa.
"The earthquake detected in Mexico City originated artificially," the Mexican engineering and mining firm said.
"Possibly by massive jumps during the goal....of Mexico in the World Cup."
The agency said at least two sensors detected the earthquake inside Mexico City at 11.32am Mexican time.
Thousands of football fans had gathered in the capital to watch Mexico's surprise 1-0 win over World Cup holders Germany.
Spectators watched the match on a big TV screen in the central Zocalo square and after the game they converged around the iconic Angel of Independence monument waving Mexico flags.

Supporter Miguel Paez, who donned a Mexican wrestling mask in the colours of the national flag, said: "We aspire to win a World Cup this time."
Mexico play their next fixture against South Korea on Saturday, before taking on Sweden on 27 June.
Germany, meanwhile, face an uphill task to become the first team to win back-to-back World Cups in 56 years.
Attention now turns to England as they prepare for their opening World Cup fixture against Tunisia on Monday.
Gareth Southgate's squad have arrived Volgograd where fans have been gathering ahead of the Three Lions' first game of the tournament.
England's first match kicks off at 7pm UK time.
