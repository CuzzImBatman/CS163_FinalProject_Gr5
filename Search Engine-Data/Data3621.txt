Mardock Scramble: The Second Combustion and Oblivion Island are confirmed for March 25.

The following was mentioned:
- There will be "a few" Ninja Scroll posters by British artist Sam Gilbey available 
at the countrywide cinema screenings taking place around the country 
from Friday November 23.
- The Hyper Japan event from Friday will include a Dragon Ball Z booth, 
including the opportunity to watch episodes, playtest the Dragon Ball Z Kinect game 
and possibly playtest the One Piece game.
- Re the Dragon Ball franchise: "We have to get all Dragon Ball Z out at first. 
If Toei are happy with the sales results, 
then we can move on to Dragon Ball Z Kai or the original Dragon Ball, 
we'll have to figure out which one. 
It probably would be better to do the original Dragon Ball first."
- The Collectors Edition of Berserk: The Golden Age Arc - The Egg of the King 
will include a book originally included with the Japanese release, 
now translated into English.
- On sub-only releases: Blue Exorcist is the bestselling U.K. sub-only release, 
but it still only sold 2000 copies between the two volumes. 
Manga has to decide if it will re-release the series with the dub created by Neon Alley. 
Mazandarani thinks that if Blue Exorcist had been released with a dub, 
it would have probably sold twice as many copies.

Mazandarani also mentioned Cardcaptor Sakura, which was recently released in a sub-only edition by Madman Entertainment in Australia. Mazandarani said he was "definitely interested in getting (it) for the U.K., as the series previously played on ITV and has a cult appeal.
- On Blu-ray releases, Mazandarani said that the Blu-ray of Puella Magi Madoka Magica 
had sold 512 copies in its first week, plus a further hundred at MCM Expo. 
However, it only sold 60 copies in the second week - a drop of 90%. 
"If there's only 500 of you that want (the series) on Blu-ray, that's not enough. 
I need a couple of thousand of you to buy the Blu-ray."

Sarah Anderson also made some comments:
- Viz Media UK will publish the manga of Tiger & Bunny from May 2013, 
and a "gag" manga version later in that year.
- Other upcoming manga releases include the two-volume slipcase edition of 
Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind(provisional U.K. release date December 6);
- the box-set of all 18 volumes of Ouran High School Host Club;
- the beginning of "three-in-one" collected editions of Neon Genesis Evangelion;
- the continuation of "three-in-one" editions of Bleach, Naruto, One Piece and Fullmetal Alchemist;
- a similar edition of Dragon Ball starting next year;
- and a "two-in-one" edition of Loveless.
- The manga 21st-Century Boys (the two-book sequel to 20th-Century Boys) will be released in 2013.
- Viz Media UK will "hopefully soon be able to announce something very exciting."
- Viz's UK sales are about 10% of the sales of the U.S. market, "but we're growing."
- Of Viz UK's bestsellers, Naruto is the top seller overall, partly because of the number of volumes; 
Death Note has the highest average sales per volume. 
Death Note continues to sell about 5000 copies a year. 
The U.K. sales of theBlue Exorcist manga are described as "amazing" and "Naruto level."
