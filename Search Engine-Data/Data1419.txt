Exoskeleton Supplement: Exoskeletons for Personal Use After Spinal Cord Injury.
Abstract
Before the development of robotic exoskeletons, mobility options beyond a wheelchair were very limited for most people lacking leg movement due to spinal cord injury (SCI). Over the years, robotic exoskeletons have become more widely available and now have the potential to be successfully used for personal use at home and in the community. However, it is important that users set realistic expectations. The features and capabilities of each robotic exoskeleton differ, and how exoskeletons are used may vary greatly between individuals. Robotic exoskeletons can allow individuals with SCI with levels of injury as high as T3 to safely and functionally walk for personal mobility or exercise.5 The following special communication will discuss important considerations surrounding exoskeleton use including feasibility, safety, cost, speed, and potential health benefits of using an exoskeleton for everyday life for people with SCI.
