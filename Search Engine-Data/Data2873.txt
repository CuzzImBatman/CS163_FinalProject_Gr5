A HUGE asteroid will be soaring close to Earth this September and there is a slim chance that it could hit us.
The European Space Agency (ESA) has listed the asteroid as the fourth most concerning object on its top 10 list of Space objects that have a non-zero chance of crashing into our planet.
The asteroid is called 2006 QV89 and it is currently travelling at around 27,400 miles per hour.
Scientists think that it is has a a one in 7,299 chance of hitting Earth.
If the impact does happen then it will occur on September 9 later this year and it's only half the size of the meteor that exploded over Russia in 2013, which shattered windows and injured 1,500 people.
Current predictions state that the asteroid will pass Earth at a distance of over 4.2 million miles but the ESA thinks there is a one hundredth of 1% chance that this prediction is wrong.
The diameter of the asteroid is up to 164 feet, which is slightly bigger than the Tunguska meteorite that smashed into Earth in 1908.
The Tunguska impact flattened an area bigger than London so 2006 QV89 could be capable of much more as it is 34 feet wider in diameter.
