NCBI to help with Rocky Mountain Genomics HackCon, June 17 – 21, 2019

The NCBI will participate in a one-day conference on June 18, 2019 and a hackathon, June 19-21, 2019 as a part of Rocky Mountain Genomics Hackcon 2019 at the BioFrontiers Institute in Boulder Colorado.

The conference will feature technical speakers in precision medicine, metagenomics, and advanced RNA-Seq analysis, as well as an exhibitor and poster session. The hackathon will focus on creating visualization tools for exploratory data analysis.

Many people who attend these events have experience working with large datasets or the development of informatics tools, code, or pipelines; however, researchers who are in earlier stages of their data science journey, including students and postdocs are also encouraged to apply. Some projects are available to other non-scientific developers, mathematicians, or librarians. The event is open to anyone selected for the hackathon and willing to travel to Boulder, Colorado.  

Please visit the Rocky Mountain Genomics Hackcon 2019 site for more details and information on how to attend.
