Slovenia to cull growing bear, wolf population after attacks.


LJUBLJANA, Slovenia – Slovenia's government has approved the culling of dozens of bears and wolves to curb the animals' growing population following a sharp increase 
in attacks on domestic animals.

The official STA news agency says more than 100 farm animals have been killed by bears or wolves this year. It said the Alpine country's bear population has grown to 
1,000 after near-extinction in early 20th century — far exceeding the ideal number for the small nation of some 2 million people.

The government on Wednesday passed a bill stipulating that the number of bears should be reduced by 200, and that a dozen wolves will be culled.


The bill comes after an environmental group managed to overturn an earlier government decree. The bill needs approval in Slovenia's parliament.
