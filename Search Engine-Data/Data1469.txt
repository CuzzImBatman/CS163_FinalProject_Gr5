White House to hold social media summit next month
It's unclear exactly who'll be invited.

The summit is reportedly scheduled for July 11.

The White House plans to hold a summit on social media. This comes as President Donald Trump and some in Congress continue to accuse the sites of being biased against conservatives. 

The summit, scheduled for July 11, "will bring together digital leaders for a robust conversation on the opportunities and challenges of today's online environment," said White House spokesman Judd Deere in an email. The White House didn't say who'll take part in the summit. Reuters earlier reported on the event.

Twitter and Google didn't respond to requests for comment. Facebook declined to comment.

On Wednesday, Trump again, without evidence, accused social media sites of censoring conservatives.

"These people are all Democrats, it's totally biased toward Democrats," Trump said in an interview with Fox Business. "If I announced tomorrow that I'm going to become a nice liberal Democrat, I would pick up five times more followers."

Social media companies, for their part, have apologized for how they've handled some conservative content, but they say they don't censor political views and they deny any bias.

Earlier this month, Sen. Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri, introduced legislation that would compel tech companies to prove their practices are politically neutral.
