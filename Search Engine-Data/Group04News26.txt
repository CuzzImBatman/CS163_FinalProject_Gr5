500 organisms annotated with the Eukaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline

This month, the NCBI Eukaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline annotated its 500th organism! The lucky winner is Pocillopora damicornis, a stony reef-building coral frequently used as an experimental model, whose larval dispersal and development are affected by environmental changes in the oceans.

Mammals dominate the list of annotated organisms with a total of 120, but we have increased coverage of invertebrates and plants – we’ve annotated 111 insects and 93 higher plants so far. See the full list of annotated organisms and request that your favorite organism(s) be annotated!

The annotations are done on publicly released assemblies, and the quality of the results is highly dependent on the availability of RNA-Seq data for the organism, so thank you all for submitting your data to SRA.

The data produced by the Eukaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline is freely available in the Reference Sequences (RefSeq) collection, BLAST non-redundant and organism-specific databases, and the Gene database; it is also downloadable from the NCBI FTP site.
