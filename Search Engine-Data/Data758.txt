Detective Chief Inspector Andy Wolstenholme said: "We extend our sympathies to his family and friends at this difficult time, and are providing support with specialist officers.
"The bar was very busy at the time of the assault and we believe many of those present would have witnessed the assault and the aftermath.

"We have spoken to some witnesses who were present at the time, but we would be keen to speak to anyone who hasn't yet made contact with us."
A 31-year-old man from Wandsworth, south west London, was arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm with intent.

He was bailed until 13 July.
