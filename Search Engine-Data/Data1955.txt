 SEOUL  (Reuters) - Creditors of Daewoo Electronics will vote next week over whether they should accept the final proposal by an Indian-led consortium to buy the South Korean appliance and TV maker, a creditor source said on Friday. 

 India's Videocon Industries Ltd. ( VEDI.BO ) and RHJ International ( RHJI.BR ), the holding company of U.S. buyout fund Ripplewood, were picked in October to buy Daewoo Electronics. The initially agreed price was about 700 billion won, but Videocon was seeking a 5 percent discount after due diligence into Daewoo, a source at one of main creditor banks said. "The terms they offer are not satisfactory," said the source, who declined to be named, adding that creditors were unhappy about terms of payment and other conditions. Daewoo's creditors would vote by letter during next week to decide whether they should accept the final terms, the source said. "The result should be out around the end of next week." Domestic creditors own 97.5 percent of the unlisted Daewoo, which was placed under a debt rescheduling program after its parent group went bankrupt in 1999. Creditor officials had previously said they wanted to sell Daewoo, which runs six plants in South Korea and 18 overseas units, for more than $1 billion. ABN AMRO AAH.AS, Woori Investment & Securities Co. ( 005940.KS ) and Samil PricewaterhouseCoopers are managing the sale.
