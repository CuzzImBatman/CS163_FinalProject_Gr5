Hong Kong extradition bill: Protesters return to streets despite suspension
Hundreds of thousands of people are protesting in Hong Kong against a controversial extradition bill, despite the bill having been suspended.
The densely-packed crowds are demanding that the bill - which would allow extradition from Hong Kong to mainland China - be completely scrapped.
The region's leader, Carrie Lam, on Sunday apologised for causing "disputes in society" over the bill.
A day earlier she delayed the bill plans after mass protests this week.
Many protesters, who fear increased Chinese influence over Hong Kong, are calling on Ms Lam to resign over the unrest.
The protests have so far remained peaceful, in contrast to the previous major demonstration on Wednesday which saw clashes between protesters and police that injured dozens.
By early Sunday afternoon, large crowds had gathered in the city's Victoria Square, many wearing black or carrying white flowers. Organisers said they hoped more than a million people would attend, though no formal estimates of the crowd have yet been made.
The progress of the march was slow, as the large numbers of people blocked many streets and crowded train stations.
Many held white flowers to mourn a protester who fell to his death on Saturday from a ledge, where hours earlier he had unfurled an anti-extradition banner.
As darkness fell, protesters started to take over major roads and crossings and surrounded the legislative council building.
They carried placards that read "the students did not riot", in response to police labelling Wednesday's student protests a riot - an offence punishable by up to 10 years in jail.
