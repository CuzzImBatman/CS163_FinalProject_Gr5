Originally only for Wii U, Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker releases on Nintendo Switch and 3DS on July 13. The Switch version features two-player co-op. Both ports include new levels from Super Mario Odyssey, but they come at a price.
Both the Switch and 3DS ports cut the four Super Mario 3D World levels: Super Bell Hill, Conkdor Canyon, Shadow-Play Alley, and Clear Pipe Cruise. If any player is interested in playing these four levels, they'll need to buy and play the Wii U version of the game.
You can play the Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker demo right now, available on both 3DS and Switch. The demo has three levels: Plucky Pass Beginnings, Mushroom Mesa, and The King of Pyropuff Peak. If you play on Switch, you can try out co-op play.
Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker isn't the only demo available on Nintendo's hardware right now. During E3 2018, we saw more of Octopath Traveler and Nintendo announced a new demo for the title would launch that very day. If you have a Switch, you can play Octopath Traveler's demo.
