 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. insurance brokerage Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. ( AJG.N ) said on Friday it will pay $36.9 million to settle a class-action lawsuit accusing it of accepting improper "contingent commissions" for steering business to particular insurers. 

 The settlement includes payments of $28 million to current and former clients who used brokers to buy insurance from 1994 to 2005. It also includes $8.85 million of legal fees. Gallagher did not admit wrongdoing, but said it settled the two-year-old lawsuit to avoid the costs and burdens of litigation. The settlement requires approval by the U.S. District Court in New Jersey. Itasca, Illinois-based Gallagher said it previously set aside substantially all costs associated with the settlement. It will, however, take a $5 million to $10 million pre-tax charge in the fourth quarter to increase its reserve for the settlement and to resolve other litigation. The complaint accused Gallagher and other brokerages of conspiring to steer business to insurers that paid hidden fees, rather than those offering the best coverage, Gallagher has said in regulatory filings. Insurance brokerages led by Marsh & McLennan Cos. ( MMC.N ) have paid more than $1 billion to resolve probes by New York State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer and other regulators into the practice, and many have abandoned contingent commissions. Gallagher shares closed Friday down 46 cents at $29.55 on the New York Stock Exchange. They have fallen 4 percent this year.
