If you are looking for Australian streaming solutions, AnimeLab.com has plenty of series 
and simulcasts here and Hanabee.com.au has a large amount of their catalog available for viewing here. 
Please note that due to the launch of AnimeLab Premium we will only be listing titles and episodes 
on the service that are available through free access.
It has come to our attention that there is conflicting information on some websites. 
If you spot discrepancies or anime being screened that isn't included on this list, please let us know on the forums!
Note: It came to our attention that we were listing AnimeLab premium titles as freely available titles 
as we were not checking the status of the episodes, this has now been corrected.
