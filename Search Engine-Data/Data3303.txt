How a Tiny Robot Could Help Save Coral Reefs
Researching coral reefs is often low-tech: scuba tanks, waterproof paper, pencils, spreadsheets.“Underwater, we’re very practical,” Emily Darling, a marine ecologist and conservation scientist with the Wildlife Conservation Society, told The Daily Beast. “But coral reef scientists also have to be cutting edge. Now, with all the threats to reefs, we have to work faster and smarter.”Coral reefs are critical to the health of ocean ecosystems, and provide food, protection from storms, and economic resources to humans. They’re also extremely vulnerable: Estimates suggest that they could die off completely by 2050.In the race to protect what they can, researchers like Darling are developing innovative hardware and software technologies to augment the painstaking work of biologists and conservationists.Darling is working on a project with the Wildlife Conservation Society and World Wildlife Fund to develop software that will help coral researchers more efficiently collect, analyze, and share their data. “We’re using the tools provided by Silicon Valley to meet the needs of scientists on the ground,” she told the Daily Beast.
