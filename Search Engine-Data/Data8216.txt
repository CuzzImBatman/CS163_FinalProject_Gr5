The longest day of the year just got a little sweeter.

For the first day of summer Thursday, several businesses are offering frozen freebies or sweet, discounted treats.

June 21 also is National Smoothie Day, National Selfie Day and a host of other made-up holidays — all good excuses for getting free food and discounts.
