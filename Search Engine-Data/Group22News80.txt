CLEVELAND — Another day, another incident between an NBA player and a fan.

After Golden State Warriors star Kevin Durant put together one of the most impressive performances of his career in Game 3 of the NBA Finals on Wednesday night, video surfaced of him being heckled by Cavaliers fans as he entered the team hotel.

"KD, you suck!" one fan can be heard shouting in the video shared by TMZ.

"Where LeBron at? ... He gonna yam on you!" yelled another.

Durant was almost at the door before he turned around and walked toward the person who was recording the video. He was quickly restrained and directed into the hotel.
When asked about the incident before Thursday's practice, Durant said it was much ado about nothing. 

"Whoever is screaming and heckling at grown men even after the game, I think that's just pure ignorance," he said. "That's just who they are at that point. So I get it. ... I just kept hearing somebody saying 'KD! KD!' and I didn't hear what they said after that. I just wanted to know what they said. I wasn't going to do anything. I just wanted to hear what they were talking about."

Though less extreme, this is the latest in a long line of player-fan incidents from this postseason.
