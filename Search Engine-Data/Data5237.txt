The Pokemon Company has confirmed that the core Pokemon RPG for Nintendo Switch, which was announced during Nintendo's E3 2017 presentation, is set to release in the latter half of 2019. This comes alongside the announcement of Let's Go Pikachu and Let's Go Eevee as well as Pokemon Quest.
The timing was confirmed in a tweet from the Pokemon company that read, "With #PokemonQuest and #PokemonLetsGo, there are so many new ways to explore the world of Pokémon! Trainers can look forward to even more with an all-new core series Pokémon RPG title in development for the second half of 2019!"
The Switch Pokemon game was teased by Pokemon Company president and CEO Tsunekazu Ishihara, who said at the time that the game may not release for over a year. He also said that series developer Game Freak would be making the game. No other details were given then or in the year following.
Recently, rumors about the upcoming Pokemon Switch game have been circulating. However, many of them--including that the game would be integrated with Pokemon Go, as well as the leaked title art--turned out to be for Pokemon Let's Go Pikachu and Let's Go Eevee, which are separate games.
