The Impossible Burger shortage: Why it's hard to find this meat-free burger
Impossible Foods’ new fast-food partnerships are causing a shortage at many of the restaurants where it was first available.

Impossible Foods is experiencing a shortage of its Impossible Burgers as it attempts to stock thousands of fast-food and chain restaurants nationwide. The company's new growth has led to short supply for many smaller, local and often family-owned restaurants who offered the Impossible Burger before it became so popular. 

If you're not yet familiar with the Impossible Burger -- the eerily meat-like meatless burger -- well, I'd have to guess that you don't go on the Internet much. All jokes aside, this "bloody" vegan hamburger has taken on the food industry with such adoration (albeit a little skepticism) that it's now one of the most widely available meatless meat products. 

The shortage has evoked an outcry from many vegetarian and vegan fans, including Instagram influencers with lots of followers and a large platform on which to share their displeasure. 

What's causing the Impossible Burger shortage?
Behind the shortage is a rather explosive surge in popularity. The burger is on the menu in more than 9,000 restaurants and is a top seller at many of those restaurants. And, since the launch of the Impossible Burger 2.0 in January 2019, the company has seen a 50% jump in revenue,  according to Impossible Food's Vice President of Communications, Jessica Appelgren. 

Another big reason people are having a hard time getting their hands on an Impossible Burger is because the company partnered with multiple national fast-food restaurants and chains, to make the burger available nationwide. The Impossible Burger has even ended up at food stands at stadiums and theme parks.  

These growth spurts come with growing pains -- the new partnerships and increased sales have come at the expense of supply at some of the first restaurants that ever stocked the Impossible Burger.
