Fans of the popular anime My Hero Academia are getting good news; we now know when Bandai Namco's upcoming game, based on the series, will release in the West. Although the company hasn't released many details about the game, My Hero One's Justice, it's set for release on Nintendo Switch, PS4, Xbox One, and PC on October 26. Check out the release date reveal trailer above.
The new trailer shows just a sliver of gameplay, which Bandai Namco describes as an arena brawler where you can choose between hero and villain on a path to justice. It says you'll be able to utilize Quirks (special moves) and call on up to two sidekicks to activate powerful attacks, where "your environments are at your disposal in total field destruction." This includes vertical battle, as you're able to scale buildings and walls during fights.
The game will let players play as tons of characters from the anime/manga series, including Izuku Midoriya, Katsuki Bakugo, Tomura Shigaraki, All Might, and many more. Each of them will have "explosive attacks" related to their Quirks. Pre-orders of the game aren't live yet but will be coming soon.
It wasn't initially clear if the game would be coming to the West at all or whether it would be released in Japan only. The series' previous game, My Hero Academia: Battle for All, launched in 2016 on 3DS but never got a Western release. A lengthier trailer for the game was released at E3 2018.
