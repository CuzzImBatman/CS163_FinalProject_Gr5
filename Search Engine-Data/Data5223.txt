If you have PS Plus, you can download and play Call of Duty Black Ops 3 for free. The deal is only eligible from June 11 - July 11. Sony announced this new PS Plus deal during its E3 2018 press conference. The deal is being promoted to give players a chance to try out Black Ops 3 prior to Black Ops 4's release later this year. It's available alongside the standard lineup of PS Plus freebies for June. [Update: The deadline for grabbing this freebie is nearly here; you've got just hours left to claim it if you haven't already. The rest of June's free games have gone back to their regular prices, but Plus members can now grab July's freebies.]
In our review of Black Ops 3, Mike Mahardy said, "[Black Ops III] tells an incomprehensible story about AI ascendancy and the moral grays of a hyper-connected future, raising intriguing questions but never bothering to answer them. At the end of it all, after hours of soulless shooting and unremarkable storytelling, Black Ops III delivered its nebulous twist, and I didn't dwell on it.
In its undead modes, and the first 10 hours of multiplayer, it excels. But in its campaign, it merely crawls forward. Black Ops III doesn't offer anything remarkable to the series, but does just enough to maintain the Call of Duty status quo. The franchise, however slowly, continues its inexorable march."
