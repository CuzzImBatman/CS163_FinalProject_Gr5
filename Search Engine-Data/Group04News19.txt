Airbus' Voom to battle Uber Copter helicopter service in US, report says
Voom also plans to expand to Asia this year, according to Fast Company.
Uber's helicopter service hasn't even taken off yet, but it already has a new competitor. Airbus-owned Voom will reportedly begin offering its on-demand helicopter shuttle service in the US this fall. It previously offered the service only in Latin America. Voom hasn't shared which cities it'll be available in or how much it'll cost to use the service, according to Fast Company, but it's said the price will be "competitive with ground alternatives." The company also reportedly said it plans to operate in Asia this year, and aims to be in 25 cities worldwide by 2025.
The app-based offering would compete with Uber Copter, the ride-hailing platform's helicopter service that takes flight in New York City next month. When it launches, Uber Copter will take passengers between Lower Manhattan and JFK International Airport, with average rides reportedly costing between $200 and $225 a person. Ride-hailing company Blade also provides a similar helicopter service.
Voom didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
