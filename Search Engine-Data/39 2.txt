The ground is drying up ...
61.90s for A'Ali winning the Norfolk Stakes. Raffle Prize 61.58s and Southern Hills 63.05s the previous day, when it rained between the two races and might have been "Soft" by the end. I am going "Good to Soft" at this stage.

Aidan OBrien had a rough time of it on Wednesday, with three consecutive beaten favourites, but Cape Of Good Hope can steer the Irishman back towards the winners enclosure. His plugging-on fourth in the French Derby was a bit dour but reads well in this company and, as a brother to Highland Reel, he should have plenty of improvement in him. Headman has become a non-runner because of the rain-softened ground but that wont be a problem for King Ottokar, who won in the Newbury mud in April, beating Dancing Willoughby, the Queens Vase winner on Wednesday. He may not have stayed in the Chester Vase and this return to 10 furlongs could help, though itll be a stiff 10 furlongs. 
Fox Chairman was also beaten at Chester, in the Dee Stakes, when he didnt get a clear run but seemed to me to lack a bit of tactical speed. Im surprised hes as short as 4-1. Sangarius was third to King Of Comedy last time, which is strong form, but his pedigree isnt crying out that he wants 10 furlongs on soft and he hung badly last time. Great Scot wont stay unless he learns to settle and is a risk in this atmosphere. Cap Francais went close behind Cape Of Good Hope at Epsom but seemed to regress at Lingfield, albeit that race was won by the subsequent Derby winner.

1st Grey/Silver 6-4fav
Nicola McGeady of Ladbrokes said: We suspended betting on the colour of the Queens hat this morning. Pink was the favourite but after witnessing a run of bets on grey/silver at 12/1, alarm bells rang. It was clearly the right decision to pull the plug with the grey gamble landing this afternoon.

Billy Lee had a dismal experience in the Queen Mary, when Ickworth refused to start, but hopefully Sunday Sovereign can brighten the Irishmans week. The colt has improved in leaps and bounds and inflicted the only defeat so far in the career of Arizona, winner of the Coventry Stakes on Tuesday. There are some unexposed rivals ranged against him but he sets a high bar. Wesley Ward runs Maven, described as having worked lights out at Kempton last week. He was offered for sale at an
