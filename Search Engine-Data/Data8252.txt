CLEVELAND — LeBron James produced another 30-point playoff game in Game 3 of the NBA Finals on Wednesday, giving him 110 postseason games with at least 30 points and passing Hall of Famer Michael Jordan for most 30-point games in the playoffs.

James collected his 31st points to get past Jordan with a three-pointer with under two minutes remaining Wednesday. Despite finishing with 33 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds, the Cavs fell 110-102 and are now one game away from being swept. 

James, playing in his 238th playoff game, needed more games than Jordan, who appeared in 179 games.

It was James’ 12th 30-point game this postseason, including fourth in his last five games.
James also moved into second place on the all-time Finals scoring list in Game 2 on Sunday. Already the league’s all-time leading scorer in the postseason, he passed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.

Though he doesn’t fancy himself as a scorer, James has been on scoring roll since mid-April, averaging nearly 35 points in the postseason. He became the sixth player in league history to score at least 50 in Game 1.
