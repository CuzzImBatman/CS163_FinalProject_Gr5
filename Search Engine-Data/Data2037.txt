Where are the women? BBC's 10 best-paid stars are still men
The BBC says it is getting closer to ending the pay gap, despite the top 10 list of big earners still being made up of men.
A 2017/18 salary report shows that Match Of The Day host Gary Lineker is the top earner, taking home about £1.75m.
Chris Evans, who was knocked off last year's top spot, was still one of the broadcaster's best-paid stars, followed by Radio 2 DJ Graham Norton.
The other top 10 earners were broadcasters Steve Wright, Huw Edwards, Jeremy Vine, Alan Shearer, Nicky Campbell, Nick Grimshaw and Stephen Nolan.
The highest-paid woman on the list is Claudia Winkleman, who is paid about £370,000.
The BBC has argued that the list does not truly reflect the balance of payments to men and women, as earnings for some shows are paid through BBC Studios.
However, the creation of the spin-off company has led to accusations that the broadcaster is hiding the true salaries of some of its biggest stars.
In the move towards gender pay equality, three of the broadcaster's highest-earning male presenters have agreed to take pay cuts.
