TV version to add scenes such as Girge vs Spartans; OVA to show Delphine's creation

The new anime project for Yunosuke Yoshinaga's fantasy robot manga Broken Blade (Break Blade) 
will be a recompiled version of all six earlier films with additional 
new scenes — plus a spinoff original video anime project that is in the works. 
The updated 12-episode television version of the 2010-2011 films will add previously unanimated scenes, such as the battle to the death between the gifted warrior Girge and the specially selected Spartan robot unit. The spinoff original video anime project will be a brand-new work that will follow the mystery of Delphine's creation, based on an original concept by Yoshinaga.
The 12-episode television version will also add a new opening theme song by Sayaka Sasaki, 
and a new ending theme song by Aira Yuki. 
It will premiere on Tokyo MX TV, Sun TV, and BS11 in April.

Sentai Filmworks released the original six films in North America, and Sentai Filmworks describes the film series:
In Cruzon, children are born with the ability to control quartz. 
This power allows them to levitate simple objects—or control enormous and complex mobile battle suits called Golems. 
But when an ancient Golem is discovered during the height of a brutal war, 
a Young King and his beautiful queen turn to Rygart Arrow. 
Though an “un-sorcerer”, Rygart can miraculously pilot this ancient and powerful weapon. 
But in war, school friends can turn into bitter enemies and allies have suspicious motives.
